 <h3>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">JOHN CALVIN A STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ORLEANS.<br />
 (1527-1528.)</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">CALVIN, whom his father's wishes and his own
convictions urged to abandon the priestly career,
for which he was preparing, had left Paris in the
autumn of 1527, in order to go to Orleans and study
jurisprudence under Pierre de l'Etoile, who was teaching
there with great credit. 'Reuchlin, Aleander, and
even Erasmus, have professed in this city,' said his
pupils; 'but the Star (Etoile) eclipses all these suns.'
He was regarded as the prince of French jurists.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>When Calvin arrived in that ancient city to which
the Emperor Aurelian had given his name, he kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
himself apart, being naturally timid, and repelled by
the noisy vivacity of the students. Yet his loving
disposition sighed after a friend; and such he found
in a young scholar, Nicholas Duchemin, who was
preparing himself for a professorship in the faculty of
letters.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span>
Calvin fixed on him an observing eye, and
found him modest, temperate, not at all susceptible,
adopting no opinion without examination,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span>
of equitable
judgment, extreme prudence, and great mildness, but
also a little slow in his movements. Duchemin's
character formed a striking contrast with the vivacity,
ardour, severity, activity, and, we will add, the susceptibility
of Calvin. Yet he felt himself attracted towards
the gentle nature of the young professor, and
the very difference of their temperaments shed an
inexpressible charm over all their intercourse. As
Duchemin had but moderate means, he received students
in his house, as many of the citizens did. Calvin
begged to be admitted also, and thus became one of
the members of his household. He soon loved Duchemin
with all the energy of a heart of twenty, and
rejoiced at finding in him a Mommor, an Olivétan,
and even more. He wanted to share everything with
Nicholas, to converse with him perpetually; and they
had hardly parted, when he began to long to be with
him again. 'Dear Duchemin!' he said to him, 'my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
friend, you are dearer to me than life.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_4" id="Ref_4" href="#Foot_4">[4]</a></span>
Ardent as
was this friendship, it was not blind. Calvin, true to
his character, discovered the weak point of his friend,
who was deficient, he thought, in energy; and he
reproved him for it. 'Take care,' he said, 'lest your
great modesty should degenerate into indolence.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_5" id="Ref_5" href="#Foot_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE STUDENTS AT ORLEANS.=</p>

<p>The scholar of Noyon, consoled by this noble friendship,
began to examine more closely the university
population around him. He was surprised to see
crowds of students filling the streets, caring nothing
for learning, so far as he could tell. At one time he
would meet a young lord, in tight hose, with a richly
embroidered doublet, small Spanish cloak, velvet cap,
and showy dagger. This young gentleman, followed
by his servant, would take the wall, toss his head
haughtily, cast impertinent looks on each side of him,
and want every one to give way to him. Farther on
came a noisy band composed of the sons of wealthy
tradesmen, who appeared to have no more taste for
study than the sons of the nobility, and who went
singing and 'larking' to one of the numerous tennis-courts,
of which there were not less than forty in the
city. Ten <i>nations</i>, afterwards reduced to four, composed
the university. The German nation combined
with 'the living and charming beauty of the body'
that of a mind polished by continual study. Its
library was called 'the abode of the Muses.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_6" id="Ref_6" href="#Foot_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin made a singular figure in the midst of the
world around him. His small person and sallow face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
formed a strong contrast with the ruddy features and
imposing stature of Luther's fellow-countrymen. One
thing, however, delighted him: 'The university,' he
said, 'is quite a republican oasis in the midst of enslaved
France.' The democratic spirit was felt even
by the young aristocrats who were at the head of each
nation, and the only undisputed authority in Orleans
was that of Pierre de l'Etoile.</p>

<p class="side">=ÉTOILE ON HERETICS.=</p>

<p>This 'morning-star'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_7" id="Ref_7" href="#Foot_7">[7]</a></span>
(as the registers of the Picard
nation call him) had risen above the fogs and was
shining like the sun in the schools. The great doctor
combined an eminently judicial mind with an affectionate
heart; he was inflexible as a judge, and tender
as a mother. His manner of teaching possessed an
inexpressible charm. As member of the council of
1528, he had advocated the repression of heresy; but
he had no sooner met Calvin at Orleans than, attracted
by the beauty of his genius and the charms of his
character, he loved him tenderly. Although opposed
to the young man's religious opinions, he was proud
of having him as his pupil, and was his friend to the
last: thus giving a touching example in the sixteenth
century of that noble christian equity which loves
men while disapproving of their opinions.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_8" id="Ref_8" href="#Foot_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin, sitting on one of the benches in the school,
listened attentively to the great doctor, and imbibed
certain principles whose justice no one at that time in
all christendom thought of disputing. 'The prosperity
of nations,' said Pierre de l'Etoile, 'depends upon
obedience to the laws. If they punish outrages against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
the rights of man, much more ought they to punish
outrages against the rights of God. What! shall the
law protect a man in his body and goods, and not in
his soul and his most precious and eternal inheritance?...
A thief shall not be able to rob us of our purses,
but a heretic may deprive us of heaven!' Jurists and
students, nobles and people, were all convinced that
the law ought equally to guarantee temporal and
spiritual goods. 'Those insensate and furious men,'
said the code which Pierre de l'Etoile was expounding
to his pupils, 'who proclaim heretical and infamous
opinions, and reject the apostolic and evangelical
doctrine of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, in one
only Godhead and one holy Trinity, ought first to be
delivered up to divine vengeance, and afterwards visited
with corporal punishment.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_9" id="Ref_9" href="#Foot_9">[9]</a></span>
Is not that a <i>public offence</i>?'
added the code; 'and although committed
against the religion of God, is it not to the prejudice
of all mankind?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_10" id="Ref_10" href="#Foot_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Pierre de l'Etoile's youthful hearers received from
these words those deep impressions which, being made
while the character is forming, are calculated to last
through life. The mind of man required time to
throw off these legal prejudices, which had been the
universal law of the understanding for more than
a thousand years.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_11" id="Ref_11" href="#Foot_11">[11]</a></span>
Could it be expected that a young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
disciple, rising up against the most venerable teachers,
should draw a distinction between the temporal and
the spiritual sphere, between the old and the new
economy, and insist that, inasmuch as grace had been
proclaimed by virtue of the great sacrifice offered to
eternal justice, it was repugnant to the Gospel of Christ
for man to avenge the law of God by severe punishments?
No: during the sixteenth, and even the
seventeenth century, almost all enlightened minds
remained, in this respect, sunk in lamentable error.</p>

<p>Calvin, bashful and timid at first, gradually came
round; his society was courted, and he conversed
readily with all. He was received into the Picard
nation. 'I swear,' he said, 'to guard the honour of
the university and of my nation.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_12" id="Ref_12" href="#Foot_12">[12]</a></span>
Yet he did not
suffer himself to be bound by the university spirit:
he had a larger mind than his fellow-students, and we
find him in relation with men of all nations, towards
whom he was drawn by a community of affection
and study. Etoile gave his lessons in the monastery
of Bonne Nouvelle. Calvin listened silently to the
master's words, but between the lessons he talked
with his companions, went in and out, or paced up
and down the hall like the rest. One day, going up to
one of the pillars, he took out his knife and carved a
C, then an A, and at last there stood the word <span class="smc">Calvin</span>,
as the historian of the university informs us. It was
<i>Cauvin</i> perhaps, his father's name, or else <i>Calvinus</i>,
for the students were fond of latinising their names.
It was not until some time after, when the Latin word
had been retranslated into French, that the Reformer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
bore the more familiar name. This <i>Calvin</i> long remained
on the pillar where the hand of the young
Picard had cut it—a name of quarrels and discussions,
insulted by the devout, but respected by many.
'This precious autograph has disappeared,' says the
historian, 'with the last vestiges of the building.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_13" id="Ref_13" href="#Foot_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN HEAD OF THE PICARD NATION.=</p>

<p>The Picards, proud of such a colleague, raised
him to the highest post in the nation—that of proctor.
Calvin was thus in the front rank in the public processions
and assemblies of the university. He had to
convene meetings, examine, order, decide, execute, and
sign diplomas. Instead of assembling his <i>nationals</i>
at a jovial banquet, Calvin, who had been struck
by the disorders which had crept into these convivial
meetings, paid over to the treasurer the sum
which he would have expended, and made a present
of books to the university library.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_14" id="Ref_14" href="#Foot_14">[14]</a></span>
Erelong his
office compelled him to display that firmness of character
which distinguished him all his life. This hitherto
unknown incident is worthy of being recorded.</p>

<p>Every year, on the anniversary of the Finding of
the Body of St. Firmin, the inhabitants of the little
town of Beaugency, near Orleans, appeared in the
church of St. Pierre, and, after the epistle had been
chanted, handed to the proctor of the Picard nation
a piece of gold called <i>maille de Florence</i>, of two
crowns' weight.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_15" id="Ref_15" href="#Foot_15">[15]</a></span>
'The origin of this ancient custom,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
they told Calvin, 'was this. On the 13th of January,
687, the body of St. Firmin the martyr having been
solemnly exhumed, a marvellous change took place
in nature. The trees put forth fresh leaves and
blossoms, and at the same time a supernatural odour
filled the air. Simon, lord of Beaugency, who suffered
from leprosy, having gone to the window of his
castle to witness the ceremony, was restored to health
by the sweet savour. In token of his gratitude he
settled an annual offering of a gold <i>maille</i>, payable
at first to the chapter of Amiens, and afterwards to
the Picard students embodied in their nation at
Orleans.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_16" id="Ref_16" href="#Foot_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin, who blames 'the old follies and nonsense
which men substitute for the glory of Jesus Christ,'
did not place great faith in this miracle. However,
as the tribute was not paid in 1527, he resolved to go
with his 'nation' and demand it. He assembled his
fellow-students, and placing a band of music and the
beadles in front, he led the procession; all his 'nationals'
followed after him in a line, and in due course
the joyous troop arrived at Beaugency, where the
<i>maille</i> was placed in his hand. It bore in front an
image of John the Baptist, and on the reverse a fleur-de-lys
with the word <i>Florentia</i>. The Picard students
were satisfied, and, with their illustrious chief at their
head, resumed the road to Orleans, bringing back the
golden <i>maille</i> in triumph, as Jason and the Argonauts
had in days of yore returned from Colchis with the
golden fleece. The procession reentered the city
amid the shouts of the university. Calvin was one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
day to rob the <i>dragon</i> of a more magnificent treasure,
and nations more numerous were to show their joy by
louder shouts of gladness.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_17" id="Ref_17" href="#Foot_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S STUDIES AND FRIENDS.=</p>

<p>Although Calvin would not separate from his
fellow-students, he often suffered in the midst of this
noisy and dissolute multitude, and turned with disgust
from the duels, intrigues, and excesses which
filled so large a space in the student life. He preferred
study, and had applied to the law with his whole
heart.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_18" id="Ref_18" href="#Foot_18">[18]</a></span>
The vivacity of his wit, the strength of his
memory, the remarkable style in which he clothed the
lessons of his masters, the facility with which he
caught up certain expressions, certain sentences, which
fell from their lips, 'the starts and flashes of a bright
mind, which he displayed at intervals,'—all this, says
a Roman-catholic historian, soon made him distinguished
by the professors.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_19" id="Ref_19" href="#Foot_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>But he was destined to find something better on
the banks of the Loire: the work begun at Paris was
to be strengthened and developed at Orleans. Calvin,
always beloved by those who knew him, made numerous
friends, especially among certain men attacked
by the priests, and whose faith was full of christian
meekness. Every day he had a serious conversation
with Duchemin.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_20" id="Ref_20" href="#Foot_20">[20]</a></span>
In order to lessen his expenses,
he had shared his room with a pious German, formerly
a grey friar, who having learnt, as Luther
said, that it is not the cowl of St. Francis which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
saves, but the blood of Jesus Christ, had thrown off
his filthy frock<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_21" id="Ref_21" href="#Foot_21">[21]</a></span>
 and come to France. The Picard
student talked with him of Germany and of the Reformation;
and some persons have thought that this
was what first 'perverted Calvin from the true
faith.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_22" id="Ref_22" href="#Foot_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=DUCHEMIN, DANIEL, WOLMAR.=</p>

<p>Next to the house of Duchemin where the wind
of the new doctrine was blowing; next to the library,
whose curator, Philip Laurent, became his friend:
Calvin loved particularly to visit the family of an
advocate where three amiable, educated, and pious
ladies afforded him the charms of agreeable conversation.
It was that of Francis Daniel, 'a person,'
says Beza, 'who, like Duchemin, had a knowledge of
the truth.' He was a grave and influential man,
possessing inward christianity, and (perhaps his profession
of lawyer had something to do with it) of a
very conservative mind, holding both to the forms and
ordinances of the Church. Calvin, on leaving the
schools, the library, and his study, used to seek relaxation
in this house. The company of educated and
pious women may have exercised a happy influence
over his mind, which he would have sought in vain
in the society of the learned. And accordingly,
whenever he was away, he did not fail to remember
his friend's mother, wife, and sister Frances.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_23" id="Ref_23" href="#Foot_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>In the company of these ladies he sometimes met a
young man for whom he felt but little sympathy: he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
was a student from Paris, Coiffard by name, lively,
active, intelligent, but selfish.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_24" id="Ref_24" href="#Foot_24">[24]</a></span>
How much he preferred
Daniel, in whom he found a mind so firm, a
soul so elevated, and with whom he held such profitable
conversations! The two friends were agreed on
one point—the necessity of a Reformation of the
Church; but they soon came to another point which
at a later day occasioned a wide divergence between
them. 'The reformation,' said the advocate, 'must
be accomplished in the Church; we must not separate
from the Church.' The intercourse between Calvin
and Duchemin gradually became less frequent; the
latter, being naturally rather negligent, did not reply
to his friend's letters.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_25" id="Ref_25" href="#Foot_25">[25]</a></span>
But Calvin's attachment for
Daniel grew stronger so long as the reformer remained
in France, and to him almost all the letters are addressed
which he wrote between 1529 and 1536.</p>

<p>But all these friendships did not satisfy Calvin; at
Daniel's, at Duchemin's, at the library, and wherever
he went, he heard talk of a man whom he soon burned
to know, and who exercised over him more influence
than all the rest. A poor young German of Rotweil,
named Melchior Wolmar, had come to Paris,
and, being forced to work for a living, had served for
some time as corrector for the press.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_26" id="Ref_26" href="#Foot_26">[26]</a></span>
Greedy of
knowledge, the youthful reader quitted his proofs
from time to time, and slipped among the students
who crowded round the illustrious John Lascaris,
Budæus, and Lefèvre. In the school of the latter he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
became a sincere christian; in the school of the former,
a great hellenist. When he took his degree of
M.A. along with a hundred others, he occupied the
first place. Having one day (when in Germany) to
make a speech in his mother-tongue, Wolmar asked
permission to speak in Greek, because, he said, that
language was more familiar to him. He had been
invited to Orleans to teach Greek; and being poor,
notwithstanding his learning, he took into his house
a small number of young children of good family.
'He was my faithful instructor,' says one of them,
Theodore Beza; 'with what marvellous skill he gave
his lessons, not only in the liberal arts, but also in
piety!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_27" id="Ref_27" href="#Foot_27">[27]</a></span>
His pupils did not call him <i>Melchior</i>, but
<i>Melior</i> (better).</p>

<p class="side">=STUDY OF GREEK.=</p>

<p>Calvin, whose exalted soul was attracted by all that
is beautiful, became attached to this distinguished
professor. His father had sent him to study civil
law; but Wolmar 'solicited him to devote himself to
a knowledge of the Greek classics.' At first Calvin
hesitated, but yielded at last. 'I will study Greek,'
he said, 'but as it is you that urge me, you also
must assist me.' Melchior answered that he was
ready to devote to him abundantly, not only his instruction,
but his person, his life, himself.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_28" id="Ref_28" href="#Foot_28">[28]</a></span>
From
that time Calvin made the most rapid progress in
Greek literature. The professor loved him above all
his pupils.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_29" id="Ref_29" href="#Foot_29">[29]</a></span>
In this way he was placed in a condition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
to become the most illustrious commentator of
Scripture. 'His knowledge of Greek,' adds Beza,
'was of great service to all the Church of God.'
What Cordier had been to him for Latin, Wolmar
was for Greek.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">CALVIN TAUGHT AT ORLEANS OF GOD AND MAN;<br />
 BEGINS TO DEFEND AND PROPAGATE THE FAITH.<br />
 (1528.)</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">CALVIN was to receive something more from Wolmar;
he was about to begin, under his guidance,
the work of all his life—to learn and to teach Christ.
The knowledge which he acquired at the university of
Orleans, philosophy, law, and even Greek, could not
suffice him. The moral faculty is the first in man,
and ought to be the first in the university also. The
object of the Reformation was to found, not an intellectual,
but a moral empire; it was to restore holiness
to the Church. This empire had begun in Calvin;
his conscience had been stirred; he had sought salvation
and found it; but he had need of knowledge, of
increase in grace, of practice in life, and these he was
about to strive after.</p>

<p class="side">=WOLMAR AND CALVIN STUDY THE EPISTLES.=</p>

<p>Melchior, like Melanchthon, had set himself to
study the Holy Scriptures in the original languages,
and in them had found light and peace. Calvin, on
his side, 'having acquired some taste for true piety,'
as he informs us, 'was burning with a great desire to
advance.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_30" id="Ref_30" href="#Foot_30">[30]</a></span>
The most intimate confidence and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
freest communication were established between the
professor and the scholar. Melchior spoke to Calvin
of Germany and the Reformation; he read the Greek
Testament with him, set before him the riches of Christ
announced therein, and, when studying the Epistles
of St. Paul, explained to him the doctrine of imputed
righteousness which forms the essence of their teaching.
Calvin, seated in his master's study, listened in silence,
and respectfully embraced that mystery so strange
and yet so profoundly in harmony with the righteousness
of God!... 'By faith,' said Wolmar, 'man is
united to Christ and Christ to him, so that it is no
longer man whom God sees in the sinner, but his
dearly beloved Son himself; and the act by virtue of
which God makes the sinner an inheritor of heaven,
is not an arbitrary one. The doctrine of justification,'
added Wolmar, 'is in Luther's opinion the capital
doctrine, <i>articulus stantis vel cadentis Ecclesiæ.</i>'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_31" id="Ref_31" href="#Foot_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>But Calvin's chief teacher was God. At Orleans
he had more of those struggles, which are often prolonged
in strong natures. Some take him simply for
a metaphysical thinker, a learned and subtle theologian;
on the contrary, no other doctor has had more
experience of those tempests that stir up the heart to
its lowest deeps. 'I feel myself pricked and stung
to the quick by the judgment of God. I am in a continual
battle; I am assaulted and shaken, as when an
armed man is forced by a violent blow to stagger a
few steps backwards.' The light which had rejoiced
him so much when he was in college at Paris, seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
almost to have faded away. 'I am like a wretched
man shut up in a deep dungeon, who receives the
light of day obliquely and in part, only through a high
and narrow loop-hole.' He persevered, however; he
fixed his eyes on Jesus, and was soon able to say: 'If
I have not the full and free sight of the sun, I distinguish
however his light afar, and enjoy its brightness.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_32" id="Ref_32" href="#Foot_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>People at Orleans soon found out that there was
something new and strange in this young man. It
was in this city, in the year 1022, that the revival of
modern times, if we may so speak, had begun among
the heads of a school of theology at that time very
celebrated. Priests and canons had told the people
who listened to them, both in Orleans and in the
neighbouring towns, 'that they ought to be filled
with the gift of the Holy Spirit; that this Spirit
would reveal to them all the depths and all the dignity
of the Scriptures;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_33" id="Ref_33" href="#Foot_33">[33]</a></span>
that they would be fed with
heavenly food and refreshed by an inward fulness.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_34" id="Ref_34" href="#Foot_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>These <i>heretics</i> had been put to death at Orleans.
Would they be seen rising again, after more than
five centuries, in the city and even in the university?
Many doctors and students opposed Calvin: 'You
are a schismatic,' they said; 'you are separating from
the Church!' Calvin, alarmed at these accusations,
was a prey to fresh anguish.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S ANGUISH AND HUMILITY.=</p>

<p>Then, as he informs us, he began to meditate on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
the Psalms, and in the struggles of David he found
an image of his own: 'Ah!' he exclaimed, 'the Holy
Spirit has here painted to the life all the pains, sorrows,
fears, doubts, hopes, anxieties, perplexities, and
even the confused emotions with which my mind is
wont to be agitated.... This book is an anatomy of
all the parts of the soul.... There is no affection in
man which is not here represented as in a glass.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_35" id="Ref_35" href="#Foot_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>This man, whom the Romish and other legends
describe as vain, proud, and insensible, desired to see
himself as he was, without screening any of his faults.
'Of the many infirmities to which we are subject,' he
said, 'and of the many vices of which we are full, not
one ought to be hidden. Ah! truly it is an excellent
and singular gain, when all the hiding-places are laid
open, and the heart is brought into the light and
thoroughly cleansed of all hypocrisy and foul infection.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_36" id="Ref_36" href="#Foot_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Such are the principles by which the Reformation
has triumphed. Its great organs desired that men's
hearts should be 'cleansed of all foul infection.' It is
a singular delusion of those writers who, seeing things
otherwise than they are, ascribe this divine work to
vile interests and base passions. According to them,
its causes were jealousy of the Augustine monks, the
ambition of princes, the greed of nobles, and the
carnal passions of priests, which, however, as we have
seen, had but too free scope during the middle ages.
A searching glance into the souls of the Reformers
lays bare to us the cause of the revival. If the
writers of whom I have spoken were right, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
Reformation ought not to have waited until Luther for
its accomplishment; for there had existed for ages in
christendom ambitious princes, greedy nobles, jealous
monks, and impure priests. But what was really
a new thing was to find men who, like the reformers,
opened their hearts to the light of the Holy
Spirit, believed in the Word of God, found Jesus
Christ, esteemed everything in comparison with
him as loss, lived the life of God, and desired that
'all hiding-places should be laid open,' and men's
hearts cleansed of all hypocrisy. Such were the true
sources of the Reformation.</p>

<p>The adversaries of the Gospel understood the
danger incurred by the Church of Rome from the
principles professed by Calvin; and hence they called
him wicked and profane, and, as he says, 'heaped
upon his head a world of abuse.' They said that
he ought to be expelled from the Church. Then
the student, 'cast down but not destroyed,' retiring
to his chamber, would exclaim: 'If I am at war with
such masters, I am not, however, at war with thy
Church, O God! Why should I hesitate to separate
from these false teachers whom the apostles call thy
enemies?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_37" id="Ref_37" href="#Foot_37">[37]</a></span>
... When cursed by the unrighteous
priests of their day, did not thy prophets remain in
the true unity of thy children? Encouraged by their
example, I will resist those who oppress us, and
neither their threats nor their denunciations shall
shake me.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_38" id="Ref_38" href="#Foot_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=PHASES OF CALVIN'S CONVERSION.=</p>

<p>The conversion of Calvin, begun at Paris, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
completed at Orleans. There are, as we have said,
several phases in this work. The first is that of the
conscience, where the soul is aroused; the second is
that of the understanding, where the mind is enlightened;
then comes the last, where the new man is built
up, where he strikes deeper root in Christ, and bears
fruit to God. At Paris, Calvin had heard in his heart
the divine voice calling him to eternal life; at Orleans,
he constantly studied the Holy Scriptures,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_39" id="Ref_39" href="#Foot_39">[39]</a></span>
and became
'learned in the knowledge of salvation,' as
Theodore Beza tells us. The Church herself has gone
through similar phases: the first epoch of her history,
that of the apostolic fathers,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_40" id="Ref_40" href="#Foot_40">[40]</a></span>
was that of simple piety
without the scientific element; the second, the age of
the apologists, was that of a christian understanding
seeking to justify its faith in the eyes of reason. Calvin
had followed this road; but he did not give way to
an intellectualism which would have brought back
death into his heart. On the contrary, the third
phase began immediately, and from day to day the
christian life became in him more spiritual and more
active.</p>

<p>The conversion of Calvin and of the other reformers—we
must insist upon this point—was not simply a
change wrought by study in their thoughts and in
their system. Calvin did not set himself the task of
inventing a new theology, as his adversaries have
asserted. We do not find him coldly meditating on
the Church, curiously examining the Scriptures, and
seeking in them a means of separating a portion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
of christendom from Rome. The Reformation was
not the fruit of abstract reasoning; it proceeded
from an inward labour, a spiritual combat, a victory
which the reformers won by the sweat of their brow,
or rather ... of their heart. Instead of composing
his doctrine chapter after chapter, Calvin, thirsting
for righteousness and peace, found it in Christ.
'Placed as in the furnace of God (they are his own
words), the scum and filth of his faith were thus
purified.' Calvin was put into the crucible, and the
new truth came forth, burning and shining like gold,
from the travail of his melted soul. In order to comprehend
the productions of nature or of art, we must
study closely the secrets of their formation. We have
on a former occasion sought to discover the generative
principle of the Reformation in the heart of
Luther; we are now striving to discern it in Calvin
also. Convictions, affections, intelligence, activity—all
these were now in process of formation in that
admirable genius under the life-giving rays of truth.</p>

<p class="side">='I SACRIFICE MY HEART TO THEE.'=</p>

<p>There came a moment when Calvin, desirous of
possessing God alone, renounced the world, which,
from that time, has never ceased to hate him: 'I have
not sued thee by my love, O Christ,' he said; 'thou
hast loved me of thy free will. Thou hast shone into
my soul, and then everything that dazzled my eyes by
a false splendour immediately disappeared, or at least
I take no count of it. As those who travel by sea,
when they find their ship in danger, throw everything
overboard, in order that, having lightened the vessel,
they may arrive safely in port; in like manner I prefer
being stripped of all that I have, rather than be deprived
of thee. I would rather live poor and miserable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
than be drowned with my riches. Having cast
my goods into the waves, I begin to have hope of escape
since the vessel is lightened.... I come to thee
naked and empty.... And what I find in thee is not
a trifling vulgar gain: I find everything there.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_41" id="Ref_41" href="#Foot_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus lifting up his hands to God, Calvin offered the
sacrifice of a heart burning with love. He made
this grand thought the charter of his nobility, his
blazon, and engraving this design on his seal, a hand
presenting a heart in sacrifice, he wrote round it:
<i>Cor meum velut mactatum Domino in sacrificium
offero</i>—'O Lord, I offer unto thee as a sacrifice my
heart immolated to thee.' Such was his device—such
was his life.</p>

<p>The eyes of many began already to be turned upon
him with admiration. The surprising clearness of
his mind, the powerful convictions of his heart, the
energy of his regenerated will, the strength of his
reasoning, the luminous flashes of his genius, and the
severe beauties of his eloquence—all betokened in
him one of the great men of the age. 'A wonderful
mind!' says Florimond de Rémond, one of his chief
adversaries, 'a mind keen and subtle to the highest
degree, prompt and sudden in its imaginations! What
a praiseworthy man he would have been, if, sifting
away the vices (heresy), the virtues alone could have
been retained!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_42" id="Ref_42" href="#Foot_42">[42]</a></span>
There was doubtless something
wanting in Calvin: he may not have had that smiling
imagination which, at the age he had now reached, generally
gilds life with the most brilliant colours; the world
appeared to him one wide shipwreck. But, possessing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
the glance of the eagle, he discovered a deliverance in
the future, and his powerful hand, strengthened by
God, was about to prepare the great transformations
of the Church and of the world.</p>

<p>He was indefatigable in labour. When the day
was ended, and his companions indulged in dissipation
or in sleep, Calvin, restricting himself to a slight
repast for fear of oppressing his head, withdrew to his
room and sat down to study the Scriptures. At
midnight he extinguished his lamp,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_43" id="Ref_43" href="#Foot_43">[43]</a></span>
and early in the
morning, when he awoke and before he left his bed, he
'ruminated,' says Beza, on what he had read and
learnt the night before.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_44" id="Ref_44" href="#Foot_44">[44]</a></span>
'We were his friends, we
shared his room with him,' said Theodore Beza's informants.
'We only tell you what we have seen.'—'Alas!'
adds the reformer, 'these long vigils, which
so wonderfully developed his faculties and enriched
his memory, weakened his health, and laid the foundation
of those sufferings and frequent illnesses which
shortened his days.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_45" id="Ref_45" href="#Foot_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN SOUGHT AS A TEACHER.=</p>

<p>His taste for Holy Scripture did not divert Calvin
from the study of law. He was unwilling that the
labours of his profession should suffer in any degree
from the labours of piety. He made such remarkable
progress in jurisprudence that he was soon looked
upon, by both students and professors, as a master and
not as a scholar.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_46" id="Ref_46" href="#Foot_46">[46]</a></span>
One day, Pierre de l'Etoile begged
him to give a lesson in his place; and the young man
of nineteen or twenty discharged his duty with so much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
skill and clearness, that he was considered as destined to
become the greatest jurist in France. The professors
often employed him as their substitute.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_47" id="Ref_47" href="#Foot_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>To knowledge he joined communion. While still
continuing to follow the lessons of Etoile, Calvin
'sought the company of the faithful servants of God,'
as he tells us. All the children of God (he thought)
should be united together by a bond of brotherly
union. He mixed also with everybody, even with the
gainsayers, and if they attacked the great doctrines of
Gospel truth, he defended them. But he did not put
himself forward. He could discern when, how far,
and to whom it was expedient to speak, and never
exposed the doctrine of Christ to the jeers of the unbeliever
by imprudence or by the fears of the flesh.
When he opened his mouth, every one of his words
struck home. 'Nobody can withstand him,' they said,
'when he has the Bible in his hand.'</p>

<p>Students who felt a difficulty in believing, townspeople
who could not understand, went and begged
him to teach them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_48" id="Ref_48" href="#Foot_48">[48]</a></span>
He was abashed. 'I am but
a poor recruit,' he said, 'and you address me as if I
were a general.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_49" id="Ref_49" href="#Foot_49">[49]</a></span>
As these requests were constantly
renewed, Calvin tried to find some hiding-place where
he could read, meditate, and pray, secure from interruption.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_50" id="Ref_50" href="#Foot_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>At one time it was the room of a friend,
a nook in the university library, or some shady retreat
on the banks of the river. But he was hardly absorbed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
in meditation or in the study of Scripture, before he
found himself surrounded by persons eager to hear him,
and who refused to withdraw. 'Alas!' he exclaimed,
'all my hiding-places are turned into public schools.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_51" id="Ref_51" href="#Foot_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly he sought still more private retreats;
for he wished to understand before he taught. The
French love to see clearly into things; but their defect
in this respect is that they often do not go deep enough,
or fail to observe that by going deep they arrive at
truths in whose presence the most eminent minds
ought to confess their insufficiency and believe in the
revelation from God. In the middle ages there had
been men who wished to bring the mysteries of the
catholic faith to the test of reason;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_52" id="Ref_52" href="#Foot_52">[52]</a></span>
Abelard was at
the head of that phalanx. Calvin was not a new
Abelard. He did not presume to fathom impenetrable
mysteries, but sought in Scripture the light and the
life of his soul.</p>

<p class="side">=HE TEACHES IN PRIVATE FAMILIES.=</p>

<p>His admirers returned to him. Several citizens of
Orleans opened their houses to him, saying: 'Come
and teach openly the salvation of man.' Calvin shrank
back. 'Let no one disturb my repose,' he said; 'leave
me in peace.' His repose, that is to say his studies,
were his only thought. But these souls, thirsting for
truth, did not yield so easily. 'A repose of darkness!'
replied the most ardent; 'an ignoble peace!<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_53" id="Ref_53" href="#Foot_53">[53]</a></span>
Come
and preach!' Calvin remembered the saying of St.
Chrysostom: 'Though a thousand persons should call
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
you, think of your own weakness, and obey only under
constraint.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_54" id="Ref_54" href="#Foot_54">[54]</a></span>
'Well, then, we constrain you,' answered
his friends. 'O God! what desirest thou of me?'
Calvin would exclaim at such moments. 'Why dost
thou pursue me? Why dost thou turn and disturb
me, and never leave me at rest? Why, despite my
disposition, dost thou lead me to the light and bring
me into play?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_55" id="Ref_55" href="#Foot_55">[55]</a></span>
Calvin gave way, however, and
understood that it was his duty to publish the Gospel.
He went to the houses of his friends. A few men,
women, and young people gathered round him, and
he began to explain the Scriptures. It was quite
a new order of teaching: there were none of those
distinctions and deductions of scholastic science, at
that time so familiar to the preachers. The language
of the young man possessed an admirable simplicity, a
piercing vitality, and a holy majesty which captivated
the heart. 'He teaches the truth,' said his hearers
as they withdrew, 'not in affected language, but with
such depth, solidity, and weight, that every one who
hears him is struck with admiration.' These are the
words of a contemporary of Calvin, who lived on the
spot, and in the very circle in which the Reformer
then moved. 'While at Orleans,' adds this friend,
Theodore Beza, 'Calvin, chosen from that time to
be an instrument of election in the Lord's work,
wonderfully advanced the kingdom of God in many
families.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_56" id="Ref_56" href="#Foot_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at Orleans, therefore, that Calvin began his
evangelist work and manifested himself to the world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
as a christian. Calvin's activity in this city is a proof
that he was then converted to the Gospel, and that he
had been so for some time; for his was not one of those
expansive natures which immediately display externally
what is within them. This first ministry of the
reformer negatives the hypotheses which place Calvin's
conversion at Orleans, or at Bourges somewhat
later, or, even later still, during his second residence
at Paris.</p>

<p>Thus the young doctor, growing in knowledge and
acting in love, refuted the objections of the gainsayers,
and led to Christ the humble souls who thirsted for
salvation. A domestic event suddenly withdrew him
from this pious activity.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XV.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">CALVIN CALLED AT BOURGES TO THE EVANGELICAL WORK.<br />
 (1528-1529.)</span></h3>

<p class="side">=CALVIN LEAVES ORLEANS.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE day, probably at the beginning of April 1528,
about the Easter holidays, Calvin received a letter
from Noyon. He opened it: it contained sad news! his
father was seriously ill. He went at once to Duchemin
in great agitation: 'I must depart,' he said.
This friend, and many others, would have wished to
keep him in a place where he had become so useful;
but he did not hesitate. He must go to his father;
he would, however, only stay as long as was necessary;
as soon as the sick man was better, he would come
back. 'I promise you to return shortly,' he said to
Duchemin.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_57" id="Ref_57" href="#Foot_57">[57]</a></span>
Calvin, therefore, bade farewell to his cherished
studies, to his beloved friends, and those pious
families in which he was advancing the kingdom of
God, and returned to Picardy.</p>

<p>We have but few particulars of his sojourn at
Noyon. Assuredly his filial piety indulged at his
father's bedside in what has been termed with reason
the sweetest form of gratitude. Yet the weak
condition of the episcopal secretary was prolonged,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
without any appearance of imminent danger. A
question began to rise up in the young man's heart:
shall he go, or shall he stay?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_58" id="Ref_58" href="#Foot_58">[58]</a></span>
Sometimes, when
seated by the sick man's pillow during the watches of
the night, his thoughts would transport him to Orleans,
into the midst of his studies and the society of his
friends; he felt himself impelled, as by a vigorous
hand, towards the places that were so dear to him,
and he made in his mind all the arrangements necessary
for his return.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_59" id="Ref_59" href="#Foot_59">[59]</a></span>
... Suddenly his father's disease
grew worse, and the son did not quit the sufferer's
bedside. The old secretary, 'a man of sound understanding
and good counsel,' says Beza, was much
respected by those around him, and love for the author
of his days was profoundly engraven in the young
man's soul. 'The title of father belongs to God,' he
said; 'when God gives it to a man, he communicates
to him some sparks of his own brightness.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_60" id="Ref_60" href="#Foot_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S FIRST LETTER.=</p>

<p>Erelong a crisis appeared to take place; the doctors
held out hopes: the patient might recover his health,
they said.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_61" id="Ref_61" href="#Foot_61">[61]</a></span>
Calvin's thoughts and desires were
turned once more towards Orleans; he would have
wished to go there instantly,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_62" id="Ref_62" href="#Foot_62">[62]</a></span>
but duty was still
the strongest, and he resolved to wait until his father's
convalescence was complete. Thus one day after another
glided away.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_63" id="Ref_63" href="#Foot_63">[63]</a></span>
Alas! the doctors were deceived.
'There is no longer any hope of a cure,' they soon told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
him; 'your father's death cannot be far off.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_64" id="Ref_64" href="#Foot_64">[64]</a></span>
Calvin,
therefore, determined (14th of May, 1528) to write
to Duchemin, which he had not yet done since his
departure. It is the first of the reformer's letters
that has been handed down to us. 'You know,' he
says, 'that I am very exact in my correspondence,
and that I carry it even to importunity.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_65" id="Ref_65" href="#Foot_65">[65]</a></span>
You will
be astonished, perhaps, that I have been wanting in
my extreme punctuality; but when you know the
cause, you will restore to me your friendship, should
I perchance have forfeited it.' He then tells Duchemin
of his father's condition, and adds: 'Happen what
may, I will see you again.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_66" id="Ref_66" href="#Foot_66">[66]</a></span>
What did happen is not
very clear. Calvin was at Noyon, as we have seen,
on the 14th of May, 1528; perhaps he remained all
the summer with the sick man. It has been concluded
from this letter to Duchemin that Gerard
Calvin died shortly after the 14th of May; at that
time <i>the approach of death</i> was certain, according to
the doctors; but doctors may be mistaken. According
to Theodore Beza, he died during his son's residence
at Bourges, nine or ten months later, and a passage
from Calvin, which we shall quote further on, confirms
Beza's testimony, of itself so decisive.</p>

<p>One circumstance, which has some interest, seems to
show that Calvin was not at Orleans during the latter
part of this year. On the 5th of December, 1528,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_67" id="Ref_67" href="#Foot_67">[67]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
eight months after his sudden departure, a boy
eight or nine years old arrived at Melchior Wolmar's
house in that city. He had a sickly look,
but was a well-made child, playful and well-bred, with
a keen glance and lively wit. This boy, who was one
day to be Calvin's best friend, belonged to a Burgundian
family. His father, Pierre de Beza, was bailli of
Vezelay, a very old town, where the child was born
on the 24th of June, 1519,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_68" id="Ref_68" href="#Foot_68">[68]</a></span>
and received the name
of Theodore. One of his uncles, named Nicholas,
seignior of Cette and of Chalonne, and councillor
of parliament, having paid the bailli a visit a few
months after the child's birth, adopted him, being
an unmarried man, and took him to Paris, although
he had not been weaned.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_69" id="Ref_69" href="#Foot_69">[69]</a></span>
Nine years later (1528),
at the recommendation of an Orleanese, who was
connected with the Bezas and a member of the
royal council, the uncle sent his nephew to Wolmar,
who was described to him as very learned in Greek
and of great experience in education. Nothing in
Calvin's biography written by Beza indicates that the
latter met Calvin at that time at Orleans. When
Margaret of Valois, who was Duchess of Berry,
endeavoured about this time to gather together a
number of pious and learned men in her university of
Bourges, she invited Wolmar there;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_70" id="Ref_70" href="#Foot_70">[70]</a></span>
and it was here
that young Beza saw Calvin for the first time.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN GOES TO BOURGES.=</p>

<p>The scholar, set at liberty by the apparent restoration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
of his father's health, had once more turned his
thoughts towards his studies. He desired to take
advantage of the instruction of a doctor whose reputation
surpassed even that of Pierre de l'Etoile. All
the learned world was at that time talking of Alciati
of Milan, whom the king had invited to Bourges, and
to attend whose brilliant lessons the academic youth
flocked from every quarter. Calvin had other motives
besides this for going to that city. Under Margaret's
influence, Berry had become a centre of evangelisation.
Returning, therefore, to Orleans, he made
known his intention of going to Bourges, and the
professors of the university where he had studied,
and even taught with credit, unanimously offered
him the degree of doctor. It would appear that his
modesty did not permit him to accept it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_71" id="Ref_71" href="#Foot_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>There were fewer resources at Bourges than at
Orleans. 'As we cannot live as we wish,' said the
students, 'we live as we can.' Everything was dear:
board alone cost one hundred francs a year.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_72" id="Ref_72" href="#Foot_72">[72]</a></span>
'France is truly a golden country,' bitterly remarked
a poor scholar, 'for without gold you can get nothing.'
But the Noyon student cared little for the comforts of
life; intellectual and spiritual wealth satisfied him.
He was anxious to hear Alciati, and was surprised to
find him a tall corpulent man, with no very thoughtful
look. 'He is a great eater,' said one of his neighbours,
'and very covetous.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_73" id="Ref_73" href="#Foot_73">[73]</a></span>
Intelligence and imagination,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
rather than sentiment, were his characteristics: he
was a great jurist and also a great poet. Mingling
literature with his explanation of the laws, and substituting
an elegant style for barbarism of language,
he gave quite a new <i>éclat</i> to the study of the law.
Calvin listened with admiration. Five years later
Alciati returned to Italy, allured by greater emoluments
and greater honours.</p>

<p>Erelong Calvin gave himself up entirely to other
thoughts. Bourges had become, under Margaret's
government, the centre of the new doctrine in France;
and he was accordingly struck by the movement of
the minds around him. There was discussing, and
speaking, and assembling, wherever the sound of the
Gospel could be heard. On Sunday students and
citizens crowded the two churches where Chaponneau
and Michel preached. Calvin went with the rest, and
found the christian truth pretty fairly set forth 'considering
the time.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_74" id="Ref_74" href="#Foot_74">[74]</a></span>
During the week, evangelical
truth was taught in the university by Gamaire, a
learned priest, and by Bournonville, prior of St.
Ambrose.</p>

<p class="side">=WOLMAR'S APPEAL TO CALVIN.=</p>

<p>But nothing attracted Calvin like Wolmar's house.
It would appear that this scholar had arrived at
Bourges before him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_75" id="Ref_75" href="#Foot_75">[75]</a></span>
It was there that Calvin met
young Beza, and then began in Theodore's heart that
filial piety which continued all his life, and that admiration
which he professed afterwards in one of his
Latin poems, where he calls Calvin</p>

<p class="center small">Romæ ruentis terror ille maximus.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_76" id="Ref_76" href="#Foot_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
And truly Calvin was training for this. If Wolmar
at Orleans had confirmed the christian faith in him,
Wolmar at Bourges was the first who invited him
distinctly to enter upon the career of a reformer.
The German doctor communicated to the young man
the books which he received from beyond the Rhine—the
writings of Luther, Melanchthon, and other evangelical
men.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_77" id="Ref_77" href="#Foot_77">[77]</a></span>
Wolmar, modest, gentle, and a foreigner,
did not think himself called to do in France what these
illustrious servants of God were doing in Germany:
but he asked himself whether there was not some
Frenchman called by God to reform France; whether
Lefèvre's young fellow-countryman, who united a
great understanding with a soul so full of energy,
might not be the man for whom this work was
reserved.</p>

<p>Wolmar seems to have been to Calvin what Staupitz
was to Luther; both these doctors felt the need of
minds of a strong temper for the great things that
were about to take place in the world. One day,
therefore, the professor invited the student to take a
walk with him, and the two friends, leaving behind
them that old city, burnt down by Cæsar and
Chilperic, rebuilt by Charlemagne, and enlarged by
Philip Augustus, drew near the banks of the Auron,
at its confluence with the Yèvre, and strolled here
and there among the fertile plains of Berry.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_78" id="Ref_78" href="#Foot_78">[78]</a></span>
At
last Wolmar said to Calvin, 'What do you propose
doing, my friend? Shall the Institutes, the Novels,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
the Pandects absorb your life? Is not theology the
queen of all sciences, and does not God call you to
explain his Holy Scriptures?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_79" id="Ref_79" href="#Foot_79">[79]</a></span>
What new ideas
then started up before Calvin! At Paris he had
renounced the priesthood, and at Bourges Wolmar
urged him to the ministry.... What should he do?</p>

<p>This was quite another calling. In the theocratic
and legal Church, the priest is the means by which
man is restored to communion with God. The special
priesthood, with which he is invested, is the condition
on which depends the virtue of the sacraments and of
all the means of grace. Possessed of a magical power,
he works the greatest of miracles at the altar, and
whoever does not partake in the ministrations of this
priesthood can have no share in redemption. The
Reformation of the sixteenth century, by setting aside
the formal and theocratic Church of Rome, which was
shaped in the image of the Jewish theocracy, and by
substituting for it the Evangelical Church, conformably
to the principles of Christ and his apostles,
transformed the ministry also. The service of the
Word became its centre—the means by which, with
the aid of the Holy Ghost, all its functions were
discharged. This evangelical ministry was to work
its miracles also; but whilst those of the legal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
ministry proceed from a mysterious virtue in the
priesthood, and are accomplished upon earthly elements,
those of the evangelical ministry are wrought
freely by the divine Word, and by a heartfelt faith in
the great love of God, which that ministry proclaims,—strange
spiritual miracles, effected within the soul,
transforming the man and not the bread, and making
him a new creature, destined to dwell eternally with
God.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN HESITATES.=</p>

<p>Did Calvin at this time see clearly the difference
between the Roman priesthood and the Gospel ministry?
We doubt it. It was not until later that his
ideas became clear upon this important point. The
notion, however, of abandoning not only the priesthood,
but also the study of the law for the Gospel, was not
new to him. More than once in his retirement, he
had already asked himself: 'Shall I not preach Christ
to the world?' But he had always shrunk away
humble and timid from this ministry. 'All men are
not suited for it,' he said; 'a special vocation is
necessary, and no one ought to take it upon himself
rashly.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_80" id="Ref_80" href="#Foot_80">[80]</a></span>
Calvin, like St. Augustin, the ancient
doctor whom he most resembled (the irregularities
excepted which mark the youth of the bishop of
Hippona), feared to undertake a charge beyond his
strength. He thought also that his father would
never consent to his abandoning the law and joining
the heretics. And yet he felt himself daily more
inclined to entertain the great questions of conscience
and christian liberty, of divine sovereignty and self-renunciation.
'So great a desire of advancing in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
knowledge of Christ consumed me at that time,' he
said, 'that I pursued my other studies very coldly.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_81" id="Ref_81" href="#Foot_81">[81]</a></span>
A domestic event was soon to give him liberty to
enter upon the new career to which God and Wolmar
were calling him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_82" id="Ref_82" href="#Foot_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor was this the only call he received at Bourges.
Wolmar had spoken of him, and several families
invited him to their houses to edify them. This took
the young man by surprise, as it had done at Orleans;
he remained silent, lost in the multitude of his
thoughts. 'I am quite amazed,' he said, 'at seeing
those who have a desire for pure doctrine gather
round me to learn, although I have only just begun
to learn myself!' He resolved, however, to continue
at Bourges the evangelical work which he had timidly
commenced on the banks of the Loire; and he brought
more time and more decision to the task.</p>

<p class="side">=THE PREACHERS IN BERRY.=</p>

<p>Calvin accordingly entered into relations with students
and townspeople, nobles and lawyers, priests
and professors. The family of the Colladons held
at that time a considerable station in Berry. Two
brothers, Leo and Germain, and two sisters, Mary
and Anne, were the first to embrace the Gospel in
Berry. Leo and Germain were advocates, and one
of their cousins, styled Germain II. in the genealogies,
now eighteen years old, afterwards became Calvin's
intimate friend at Geneva. These ties of friendship
had probably begun at Bourges.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_83" id="Ref_83" href="#Foot_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
The evangelist soon extended his christian activity
beyond the walls of the city. Many natives of Berry,
who had heard him at Bourges, had been charmed
with his addresses. 'Come and preach these beautiful
words to us,' they said. Calvin gradually laid
aside his natural timidity, and being cheerful and fond
of walking, he visited the castles and villages.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_84" id="Ref_84" href="#Foot_84">[84]</a></span>
He introduced
himself affectionately into all the houses at
which he stopped. 'A graceful salutation,' he said
in after years, 'serves as an introduction to converse
with people.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_85" id="Ref_85" href="#Foot_85">[85]</a></span>
He delivered several sermons in these
hamlets and country-seats.</p>

<p>On the banks of the Arnon, ten leagues from
Bourges, there stands a little town named Lignières,
at that time the seat of a considerable lordship.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_86" id="Ref_86" href="#Foot_86">[86]</a></span>
Every
year certain monks came to preach in the parish
church, and were bountifully received at the château,
where they complained of their wretchedness in the
most pitiable tone. This offended the lord of Lignières,
who was not of a superstitious character. 'If
I am not mistaken,' he said, 'it is with a view to
their own gain that these monks pretend to be such
drudges.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_87" id="Ref_87" href="#Foot_87">[87]</a></span>
Disgusted with their hypocrisy, M. de
Lignières begged Calvin to come and preach in their
stead. The law-student spoke to an immense crowd
with such clearness, freedom, depth, and vitality, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
every one was moved.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_88" id="Ref_88" href="#Foot_88">[88]</a></span>
'Upon my word,' said the
lord to his wife, 'Master John Calvin seems to me to
preach better than the monks, and he goes heartily to
work too.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_89" id="Ref_89" href="#Foot_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT AT BOURGES.=</p>

<p>When the priests saw the young evangelist so well
received, they cried out and intrigued against him,
and did all in their power to get him put into prison.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_90" id="Ref_90" href="#Foot_90">[90]</a></span>
It was at Bourges that Calvin began to see that 'everything
among men is full of vexation.' He said: 'By
the assaults made against them, Christ sounds the
trumpet to his followers, in order that they may
prepare themselves more cheerfully for battle.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_91" id="Ref_91" href="#Foot_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>In this way Calvin laboured in the town, in the
villages, and in the châteaux, conversing tenderly
with children, preaching to adults, and training heroes
and martyrs. But the same circumstance which had
taken him away from Orleans, suddenly occurred at
Bourges. One day he received a letter from Noyon,
written probably by his brother Anthony. Alas! his
father was dead! and he was far from him, unable to
lavish upon him the attentions of his filial piety.
'While he was at Bourges his father died,' says
Theodore Beza, 'and he was obliged to return to
Noyon.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_92" id="Ref_92" href="#Foot_92">[92]</a></span>
The death was very sudden.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_93" id="Ref_93" href="#Foot_93">[93]</a></span>
Calvin did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
not hesitate; he bade farewell to Berry, to those pious
families which he had edified, to his studies, and to
his friends. 'You held out your hand to me,' he
said to Wolmar, 'and were ready to support me from
one end to the other of my course; but my father's
death takes me away from our conversations and our
lessons.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_94" id="Ref_94" href="#Foot_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Bourges did not fall back into darkness after Calvin's
departure. A venerable doctor, named Michel
Simon, perhaps that <i>Michel</i> whom we have already
mentioned, displayed a holy boldness notwithstanding
his age. One day a Pelagian cordelier (as all the
doctors of that order are) had effrontery enough to
maintain that man can be saved by his natural
strength alone. Simon confronted him, and succeeded
in getting it laid down that in the public disputations
every proposition must be established by
the text of Scripture. This gave a new impulse to
theological studies.</p>

<p>The priests came to an understanding with one
another, and made their preparations without saying
a word. On the following Sunday, Michel Simon,
having entered the pulpit, was about to begin his sermon,
when the curé, with his vicars and choristers,
entered the choir, and began to chant the office for
the dead. It was impossible either to preach or to
hear. The exasperated students rushed into the
choir, threw the books about, upset the lecterns, and
drove out the priests, who ran off 'in great disorder.'
Simon, who remained master of the field, delivered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
his sermon, and, to the surprise of his hearers, ended
by repeating the Lord's prayer <i>in French</i>, without
adding the <i>Ave Maria</i>! Whereupon a man, sitting
in one of the upper stalls (he was the king's proctor),
stood up, and with a sonorous voice began:
<i>Ave Maria, gratia</i>.... He could not complete the
sentence. A universal shout interrupted him; the
women, who are easily excited, caught up their little
stools, crowded round the proctor, and shook them
over his head. These people were catholics, disgusted
with the priests, not with the disciples of the
Saviour.</p>

<p>While the student of Noyon was devoting himself
to the preaching of the Gospel, extreme danger threatened
him who had been his forerunner in this work.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">BERQUIN, THE MOST LEARNED OF THE NOBILITY,<br />
 A MARTYR FOR THE GOSPEL.<br />
 (1529.)</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Calvin passed through the capital on his
way from Bourges to Noyon, on the occasion of
his father's death, he might have remarked a certain
agitation among his acquaintances. In fact, the
Sorbonne was increasing its exertions to destroy
Berquin, who, forsaken by almost everybody, had no
one to support him but God and the Queen of Navarre.</p>

<p class="side">=MARGARET'S SORROWS.=</p>

<p>Margaret, who was at St. Germain-en-Laye, enjoyed
but little repose. The brilliant court of Francis I.
filled the noble palace with their pastimes. Early in
the morning every one was afoot; the horns sounded,
and the king set off, accompanied by the King of
Navarre, a crowd of nobles, the Duchess of Etampes,
and many other ladies, and joined one of those great
hunting parties of which he was so fond. Margaret,
remaining alone, recalled her sorrows, and sought the
<i>one thing needful</i>. Her husband sometimes indulged
in gaming, and the queen entreated Montmorency to
give him good advice. Henry, who thought his wife
rather too pious, complained of this with all the
impetuosity of his character. It was not Margaret's
only vexation. At first her mother had appeared to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
take part with the Reformation. One day, in December
1522, Louisa of Savoy had said to her daughter, who
was delighted to hear it: 'By the grace of the Holy
Ghost, my son and I are beginning to know these
hypocrites, white, black, grey, and all colours....
May God, by his mercy and infinite goodness, defend
us from them; for, if Jesus Christ is not a liar, there
is no such dangerous brood in all human nature.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_95" id="Ref_95" href="#Foot_95">[95]</a></span>
But this princess, whose morality was more than
doubtful, had now become reconciled, and even
leagued with these 'hypocrites black, white, and
grey,' and the king was beginning to give them his
support. Thus Margaret saw the three objects of
her tenderest affection alienating themselves from
God; and remaining at the palace while Francis with
his lords and ladies and his hounds was chasing the
wild animals, she walked sadly in the park, saying to
herself:</p>

<p class="side">=SORBONNE PLOTS AGAINST BERQUIN.=</p>

<p>Whilst Margaret was seeking consolation in God,
there came a support which she had not expected.
Erasmus was growing uneasy; the letters which he
received were full of alarming news; he saw that
Francis I., on whom he had so much relied, was
stumbling and ready to fall. This would give the
victory to the Sorbonne. Having a presentiment that
the ultramontanists were daring revolutionists, prepared
to sacrifice not only literature and the Gospel,
but royalty itself, he laid aside his usual prudence,
and resolved to tear the veil from the king's eyes,
which concealed the perverted designs of the Roman
party, and to show him conspirators in those who
called themselves the supporters of the throne. 'These
men,' he wrote, 'under the cloak of the interests of
the faith, creep into all sorts of dark ways. Their
only thought is of bringing the august heads of monarchs
under their yoke and of suspending their
power. Wait a little. If a prince resists them, they
call him a favourer of heresy, and say that it is the
duty of the Church (that is to say, of a few apocryphal
monks and false doctors) to dethrone him.
What! shall they be permitted to scatter their poisons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
everywhere, and we be forbidden to apply the antidote?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_97" id="Ref_97" href="#Foot_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>This epistle from the prince of letters, who with so
much discernment placed his finger on the sore, soon
became known; and when it reached the Sorbonne,
the doctors, dismayed that a man so moderate and
respected should reveal their secrets so boldly, saw no
other means of saving their cause than by striking
their enemies with terror. They dared do nothing
against the sage of Rotterdam, who was besides out of
their reach; but they swore that his friend Berquin
should pay for his master. The theologians of the
Sorbonne demanded that this gentleman should be
brought to trial; Duprat, Louisa of Savoy, and Montmorency
supported their petition. There was no
means of evading it, and twelve judges were nominated
by the pope and by the king.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_98" id="Ref_98" href="#Foot_98">[98]</a></span>
These men were
greatly embarrassed, for Berquin's irreproachable life,
amiable character, inexhaustible charity, and regular
attendance at public worship, had won universal
esteem. However, as the first president De Selva,
the fourth president Pailot, and some others, were
either weak or fanatical persons, the Sorbonne did not
lose all hope. One alone of the twelve caused any
fear: this was William Budæus, called by Erasmus
'the prodigy of France;' an enlightened man, who,
while professing a great respect for the Catholic
Church, had more than once betrayed certain evangelical
tendencies to his wife and children. The
twelve judges proceeded with their investigation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
without requiring the accused man to be shut up
in prison. Berquin went and came as he pleased; he
spoke to the judges and parliament, and convinced
them of his innocence. But terror began to paralyse
the weak minds among them; they were afraid
of the righteous man; they would have nothing to
do with 'that sort of people,' and turned their backs
upon him.</p>

<p class="side">=MARGARET INTERCEDES FOR BERQUIN=</p>

<p>Berquin now resolved to address the king and to
get Margaret to support him. 'It was generally reported,'
says one of the enemies of the Reform, 'that
the Queen of Navarre took wondrous pains to save
those who were in danger, and that she alone prevented
the Reformation from being stifled in the
cradle.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_99" id="Ref_99" href="#Foot_99">[99]</a></span>
Berquin went to the palace, and made his
danger known to the queen. He found in Margaret
the compassion which failed him elsewhere. She knew
that we ought not 'to stand aside from those who
suffer persecution for the name of Christ, and would
not be ashamed of those in whom there was nothing
shameful.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_100" id="Ref_100" href="#Foot_100">[100]</a></span>
Margaret immediately took up her pen,
and sitting down at that table where she had so often
pleaded both in prose and verse the cause of Christ
and of christians, she wrote the king the following
letter:—</p>

<p>'Monseigneur,—The unhappy Berquin, who maintains
that God, through your goodness, has twice saved
his life, presents himself before you, to make manifest
his innocence to you, having no one else to whom he
can apply. Knowing, Monseigneur, the esteem in
which you hold him, and the desire which he has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
now and always has had to serve you, I fear not
to entreat that you will be pleased to have pity
upon him. He will convince you that these heretic-finders
are more slanderous and disobedient towards
you than zealous for the faith. He knows, Monseigneur,
that you desire to maintain the rights of
every one, and that the just man needs no advocate
in the eyes of your compassion. For this cause I shall
say no more. Entreating Him who has given you
such graces and virtues to grant you a long and
happy life, in order that he may long be glorified by
you in this world and everlastingly in the world to
come,</p>

<p>'Your most obedient and most humble subject and
sister,</p>

<div class="foot">
<div class="right1">'<span class="smc">Margaret</span>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_101" id="Ref_101" href="#Foot_101">[101]</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>Having finished, the queen rose and gave the letter
to Berquin, who immediately sought an audience of
the king. We know not how he was received, or
what effect Margaret's intercession had upon Francis.
It would seem, however, that the king addressed a
few kind words to him. We know at least that Beda
and the Sorbonne were uneasy, and that, fearing to see
their victim once more escape them, they increased
their exertions, and brought one charge after another
against him. At last the authorities gave way; the
police received orders to avoid every demonstration
calculated to alarm him, lest he should escape to
Erasmus at Basle. All their measures were arranged,
and at the moment when he least expected it, about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
three weeks before Easter (in March 1529), Berquin
was arrested and taken to the Conciergerie.</p>

<p class="side">=BERQUIN'S LETTER DISCOVERED.=</p>

<p>Thus then was 'the most learned of the nobles,'
as he was termed, thrown into prison in despite of
the queen. He paced sadly up and down his cell,
and one thought haunted him. Having been seized
very unexpectedly, he had left in his room at Paris
certain books which were condemned at Rome, and
which consequently might ruin him. 'Alas!' he
exclaimed, 'they will cost me serious trouble!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_102" id="Ref_102" href="#Foot_102">[102]</a></span>
Berquin resolved to apply to a christian friend
whom he could trust, to prevent the evil which he
foresaw; and the next day after his incarceration,
when the domestic, who had free access to him, and
passed in and out on business, came for orders, the
prisoner gave him, with an anxious and mysterious
air, a letter which he said was of the greatest importance.
The servant immediately hid it under his
dress. 'My life is at stake,' repeated Berquin. In
that letter, addressed to a familiar friend, the prisoner
begged him without delay to remove the books
pointed out to him and to burn them.</p>

<p>The servant, who did not possess the courage
of a hero, departed trembling. His emotion increased
as he proceeded, his strength failed him, and
as he was crossing the Pont au Change, and found
himself in front of the image of Our Lady, known
as <i>la belle ymage</i>, the poor fellow, who was rather
superstitious, although in Berquin's service, lost his
presence of mind and fainted. 'A sinking of the
heart came over him, and he fell to the ground as
if in a swoon,' says the catholic chronicler.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_103" id="Ref_103" href="#Foot_103">[103]</a></span>
The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
neighbours and the passers-by gathered round him,
and lifted him up. One of these kind citizens, eager
to assist him, unbuttoned his coat to give him room
to breathe, and found the letter which had been so
carefully hidden. The man opened and read it; he
was frightened, and told the surrounding crowd what
were its contents. The people declared it to be a
miracle: 'He is a heretic,' they said. 'If he has
fallen like a dead man, it is the penalty of his crime;
it was Our Lady who did it.'—'Give me the letter,'
said one of the spectators; 'the famous Jacobin doctor
who is preaching the Lent sermons at St. Bartholomew's
dines with me to-day. I will show it to him.'
When the dinner-hour came, the company invited by
this citizen arrived, and among them was the celebrated
preacher of the Rue St. Jacques in his white
robe and scapulary and pointed hood. This Jacobin
monk was no holiday inquisitor. He understood the
great importance of the letter, and, quitting the table,
hastened with it to Beda, who, quite overjoyed at the
discovery, eagerly laid it before the court. The
christian gentleman was ruined. The judges found
the letter very compromising. 'Let the said Berquin,'
they ordered, 'be closely confined in a strong tower.'
This was done. Beda, on his side, displayed fresh
activity; for time pressed, and it was necessary to
strike a decisive blow. With some the impetuous
syndic spoke gently, with others he spoke loudly; he
employed threats and promises, and nothing seemed
to tire him.</p>

<p>From that hour Berquin's case appeared desperate.
Most of his friends abandoned him; they were afraid
lest Margaret's intervention, always so powerful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
should now prove unavailing. The captive alone did
not give way to despair. Although shut up in a
strong tower, he possessed liberty and joy, and uplifting
his soul to God, he hoped even against hope.</p>

<p class="side">=BERQUIN'S SENTENCE.=</p>

<p>On Friday, the 16th of April, 1529, the inquiry was
finished, and at noon Berquin was brought into court.
The countenance of Budæus was sorrowful and kind;
but the other judges bore the stamp of severity on
their features. The prisoner's heart was free from
rancour, his hands pure from revenge, and the calm of
innocence was on his face. 'Louis Berquin,' said the
president, 'you are convicted of belonging to the
sect of Luther, and of having written wicked books
against the majesty of God and of his glorious mother.
Wherefore we condemn you to do public penance,
bareheaded and with a lighted taper in your hand, in
the great court of our palace, asking pardon of God,
of the king, and of justice, for the offence you have
committed. You shall then be taken, bareheaded and
on foot, to the Grève, where you shall see your books
burnt. Next you shall be led to the front of the
church of Notre Dame, where you shall do penance
to God and the glorious Virgin, his mother. Afterwards
you shall have your tongue pierced—that instrument
of unrighteousness by which you have so
grievously sinned.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_104" id="Ref_104" href="#Foot_104">[104]</a></span>
Lastly, you shall be taken to the
prison of Monsieur de Paris (the bishop), and be shut
up there all your life between four walls of stone;
and we forbid you to be supplied either with books to
read, or pen and ink to write.'</p>

<p>Berquin, startled at hearing such a sentence, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
Erasmus terms 'atrocious,' and which the pious nobleman
was far from expecting,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_105" id="Ref_105" href="#Foot_105">[105]</a></span>
 at first remained silent,
but soon regaining his usual courage, and looking
firmly at his judges,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_106" id="Ref_106" href="#Foot_106">[106]</a></span>
 he said: 'I appeal to the king.'—'Take
care,' answered his judges; 'if you do not
acquiesce in our sentence, we will find means to prevent
you from ever appealing again.' This was clear. Berquin
was sent back to prison.</p>

<p>Margaret began to fear that her brother would
withdraw his support from the evangelicals. If the
Reformation had been a courtly religion, Francis
would have protected it; but the independent air that
it seemed to take, and, above all, its inflexible holiness,
made it distasteful to him. The Queen of Navarre
saw that the unhappy prisoner had none but the Lord
on his side. She prayed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent4">Thou, God, alone canst say:</div>
<div class="verse">Touch not my son, take not his life away.</div>
<div class="verse">Thou only canst thy sovereign hand outstretch</div>
<div class="verse">To ward the blow.<span
     class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_107" id="Ref_107" href="#Foot_107">[107]</a></span></div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Everything indicated that the blow would be struck.
On the afternoon of the very day when the sentence
had been delivered, Maillard, the lieutenant-criminal,
with the archers, bowmen, and arquebusiers of the city,
surrounded the Conciergerie. It was thought that
Berquin's last hour had come, and an immense crowd
hurried to the spot. 'More than twenty thousand
people came to see the execution,' says a manuscript.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_108" id="Ref_108" href="#Foot_108">[108]</a></span>
'They are going to take one of the king's officers to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
Grève,' said the spectators. Maillard, leaving his
troops under arms, entered the prison, ordered the
martyr's cell to be opened, and told him that he had
come to execute the sentence. 'I have appealed to the
king,' replied the prisoner. The lieutenant-criminal
withdrew. Everybody expected to see him followed
by Berquin, and all eyes were fixed upon the gate;
but no one appeared. The commander of the troops
ordered them to retire; the archers marched back,
and 'the great throng of people that was round the
court-house and in the city separated.' The first
president immediately called the court together, to
take the necessary measures. 'We must lose no time,'
said some, 'for the king has twice already rescued him
from our hands.' Was there no hope left?</p>

<p class="side">=BUDÆUS TRIES TO SAVE BERQUIN.=</p>

<p>There were in France at that time two men of the
noblest character, both friends of learning, whose whole
lives had been consecrated to doing what was right:
they were Budæus on the bench, and Berquin in his
cell. The first was united to the second by the
purest friendship, and his only thought was how to
save him. But what could he do singly against the
parliament and the Sorbonne? Budæus shuddered
when he heard of his friend's appeal; he knew the
danger to which this step exposed him, and hastened
to the prison. 'Pray do not appeal!' said he; 'a second
sentence is all ready, and it orders you to be put
to death. If you accept the first, we shall be able to
save you eventually. Pray do not ruin yourself!'
Berquin, a more decided man than Budæus, would
rather die than make any concession to error. His
friend, however, did not slacken his exertions; he
desired at whatever risk to save one of the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
distinguished men of France. Three whole days
were spent by him in the most energetic efforts.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_109" id="Ref_109" href="#Foot_109">[109]</a></span>
He had hardly quitted his friend before he returned and
sat down by his side or walked with him sorrowfully
up and down the prison. He entreated him for his own
safety, for the good of the Church, and for the welfare
of France. Berquin made no reply; only, after
a long appeal from Budæus, he gave a nod of dissent.
Berquin, says the historian of the University
of Paris, 'sustained the encounter with indomitable
obstinacy.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_110" id="Ref_110" href="#Foot_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=BERQUIN'S FALL AND RECOVERY=</p>

<p>Would he continue firm? Many evangelicals were
anxiously watching the struggle. Remembering the
fall of the apostle Peter at the voice of a serving-maid,
they said one to another that a trifling opposition was
sufficient to make the strongest stumble. 'Ah!' said
Calvin, 'if we cease but for an instant to lean upon the
hand of God, a puff of wind, or the rustling of a falling
leaf, is enough ... and straightway we fall!' It was
not a puff of wind, but a tempest rather, by which
Berquin was assailed. While the threatening voices
of his enemies were roaring around him, the gentle
voice of Budæus, full of the tenderest affection, penetrated
the prisoner's heart and shook his firmest resolutions.
'O my dear friend,' said Budæus, 'there
are better times coming, for which you ought to preserve
yourself.' Then he stopped, and added in a
more serious tone: 'You are guilty towards God and
man if by your own act you give yourself up to
death.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_111" id="Ref_111" href="#Foot_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
Berquin was touched at last by the perseverance of
this great man; he began to waver; his sight became
troubled. Turning his face away from God, he bent
it to the ground. The power of the Holy Spirit was
extinguished in him for a moment (to use the language
of a reformer), and he thought he might be more useful
to the kingdom of God by preserving himself for
the future, than by yielding himself up to present
death. 'All that we ask of you is to beg for pardon.
Do we not all need pardon?' Berquin consented to
ask pardon of God and the king in the great court of
the palace of justice.</p>

<p>Budæus ran off with delight and emotion to inform
his colleagues of the prisoner's concession. But at
the very moment when he thought he had saved his
friend, he felt a sudden sadness come over him. He
knew at what a price Berquin would have to purchase
his life; besides, had he not seen that it was only after
a struggle of nearly sixty hours that the prisoner had
given way? Budæus was uneasy. 'I know the man's
mind,' he said. 'His ingenuousness, and the confidence
he has in the goodness of his cause, will be his ruin.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_112" id="Ref_112" href="#Foot_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>During this interval there was a fierce struggle in
Berquin's soul. All peace had forsaken him; his
conscience spoke tumultuously. 'No!' he said to
himself, 'no sophistry! Truth before all things! We
must fear neither man nor torture, but render all
obedience to God. I will persevere to the end; I will
not pray the leader of this good war for my discharge.
Christ will not have his soldiers take their ease until
they have conquered over death.'</p>

<p>Budæus returned to the prison shortly afterwards.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
'I will retract nothing,' said his friend; 'I would
rather die than by my silence countenance the condemnation
of truth.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_113" id="Ref_113" href="#Foot_113">[113]</a></span>
He was lost! Budæus withdrew,
pale and frightened, and communicated the
terrible news to his colleagues. Beda and his friends
were filled with joy, being convinced that to remove
Berquin from the number of the living was to remove
the Reformation from France. The judges, by an unprecedented
exercise of power, revised their sentence,
and condemned the nobleman to be strangled and then
burnt on the Grève.</p>

<p>Margaret, who was at St. Germain, was heartbroken
when she heard of this unexpected severity. Alas!
the king was at Blois with Madame ——.... Would
there be time to reach him? She would try. She wrote
to him again, apologising for the very humble recommendations
she was continually laying before him, and
adding: 'Be pleased, Sire, to have pity on poor Berquin,
who is suffering only because he loves the Word
of God and obeys you. This is the reason why those
who did the contrary during your captivity hate him
so; and their malicious hypocrisy has enabled them
to find advocates about you to make you forget his
sincere faith in God and his love for you.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_114" id="Ref_114" href="#Foot_114">[114]</a></span>
After having uttered this cry of anguish, the Queen of Navarre
waited.</p>

<p class="side">=THE EXECUTION HURRIED ON.=</p>

<p>But Francis gave no signs of life. In his excuse it
has been urged that if he had at that time been victorious
abroad and honoured at home, he would have
saved Berquin once more; but the troubles in Italy and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
the intrigues mixed up with the treaty of Cambray,
signed three months later, occupied all his
thoughts. These are strange reasons. The fact is,
that if the king (as is probable) had desired to save
Berquin, he had not the opportunity; the enemies
of this faithful christian had provided against that.
They had scarcely got the sentence in their hands,
when they called for its immediate execution. They
fancied they could already hear the gallop of the horse
arriving from Blois, and see the messenger bringing
the pardon. Beda fanned the flame. Not a week's
delay, not even a day or an hour! 'But,' said some,
'this prevents the king from exercising the right of
pardon, and is an encroachment upon his royal authority.'—'It
matters not! put him to death!'—The
judges determined to have the sentence carried out
the very day it was delivered, '<i>in order that he might
not be helped by the king</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_115" id="Ref_115" href="#Foot_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning of the 22nd of April, 1529,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_116" id="Ref_116" href="#Foot_116">[116]</a></span>
the officers of parliament entered the gloomy cell where
Berquin was confined. The pious disciple, on the
point of offering up his life voluntarily for the name
of Jesus Christ, was absorbed in prayer; he had long
sought for God and had found him; the Lord was near
him, and peace filled his soul. Having God for his
father, he knew that nothing would be wanting to him
in that last hour when everything else was to fail him:
he saw a triumph in reproach, a deliverance in death.
At the sight of the officers of the court, some of whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
appeared embarrassed, Berquin understood what they
wanted. He was ready; he rose calm and firm, and
followed them. The officers handed him over to the
lieutenant-criminal and his sergeants, who were to
carry out the sentence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile several companies of archers and bowmen
were drawn up in front of the Conciergerie.
These armed men were not alone around the prison.
The news had spread far and wide that a gentleman
of the court, a friend of Erasmus and of the Queen of
Navarre, was about to be put to death; and accordingly
there was a great commotion in the capital. A
crowd of common people, citizens, priests and monks,
with a few gentlemen and friends of the condemned
noble, waited, some with anger, others with curiosity,
and others with anguish, for the moment when he
would appear. Budæus was not there; he had not
the courage to be present at the punishment. Margaret,
who was at St. Germain, could almost see the
flames of the burning pile from the terrace of the
château.</p>

<p>When the clock struck twelve, the escort began to
move. At its head was the grand penitentiary Merlin;
then followed the archers and bowmen, and after
them the officers of justice and more armed men.
In the middle of the escort was the prisoner. A
wretched tumbrel was bearing him slowly to punishment.
He wore a cloak of velvet, a doublet of satin
and damask, and golden hose, says the Bourgeois of
Paris, who probably saw him pass.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_117" id="Ref_117" href="#Foot_117">[117]</a></span>
The King of
heaven having invited him to the wedding, Berquin
had joyfully put on his finest clothes. 'Alas!' said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
many as they saw him, 'he is of noble lineage, a very
great scholar, expert and quick in learning ... and
yet he has gone out of his mind!' There was nothing
in the looks or gestures of the reformer which
indicated the least confusion or pride. He neither
braved nor feared death: he approached it with tranquillity,
meekness, and hope, as if entering the gates
of heaven. Men saw peace unchangeable written on
his face. Montius, a friend of Erasmus, who had
desired to accompany this pious man even to the
stake, said in the highest admiration: 'There was
in him none of that boldness, of that hardened air
which men led to death often assume; the calmness
of a good conscience was visible in every feature.'—'He
looks,' said other spectators, 'as if he were in
God's house meditating upon heavenly things.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_118" id="Ref_118" href="#Foot_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=BERQUIN'S MARTYRDOM.=</p>

<p>At last the tumbrel had reached the place of punishment,
and the escort halted. The chief executioner
approached and desired Berquin to alight. He did
so, and the crowd pressed more closely round the ill-omened
spot. The principal officer of the court, having
beckoned for silence with his hand, unrolled a
parchment, and read the sentence 'with a husky
voice,' says the chronicler. But Berquin was about
to die for the Son of God who had died for him; his
heart did not flinch one jot; he felt no confusion, and
wishing to make the Saviour who supported him in
that hour of trial known to the poor people around
him, he uttered a few christian words. But the
doctors of the Sorbonne were watching all his movements,
and had even posted about a certain number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
of their creatures in order to make a noise if they
thought it was necessary. Alarmed at hearing the
soft voice of the evangelist, and fearing lest the people
should be touched by his words, these 'sycophants'
hastily gave the signal. Their agents immediately
began to shout, the soldiers clashed their arms, 'and
so great was the uproar that the voice of the holy
martyr was not heard in the extremity of death.'
When Berquin found that these clamours drowned
his voice, he held his peace. A Franciscan friar,
who had accompanied him from the prison, eager to
extort from him one word of recantation, redoubled
his importunities at this last moment; but the martyr
remained firm. At length the monk was silent,
and the executioner drew near. Berquin meekly
stretched out his head; the hangman passed the cord
round his neck and strangled him.</p>

<p class="side">=EFFECT ON THE SPECTATORS.=</p>

<p>There was a pause of solemn silence ... but not
for long. It was broken by the doctors of the Sorbonne
and the monks, who hastily went up and contemplated
the lifeless body of their victim. No one
cried 'Jesus! Jesus!'—a cry of mercy heard even
at the execution of a parricide. The most virtuous
man in France was treated worse than a murderer.
One person, however, standing near the stake, showed
some emotion, and, strange to say, it was the grand
penitentiary Merlin. 'Truly,' he said, 'so good a
christian has not died these hundred years and
more.' The dead body was thrown into the flames,
which mounted up and devoured those limbs once so
vigorous and now so pale and lifeless. A few men,
led away by passion, looked on with joy at the progress
of the fire, which soon consumed the precious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
remains of him who should have been the reformer of
France. They imagined they saw heresy burnt out,
and when the body was entirely destroyed, they
thought that the Reformation was destroyed with it,
and that not a fragment of it remained. But all the
spectators were not so cruel. They gazed upon the
burning pile with sorrow and with love. The christians
who had looked upon Berquin as the future
reformer of France, were overwhelmed with anguish
when they saw the hero in whom they had hoped
reduced to a handful of dust. The temper of the
people seemed changed, and tears were seen to flow
down many a face. In order to calm this emotion,
certain rumours were set afloat. A man stepped out
of the crowd, and going up to the Franciscan confessor,
asked him: 'Did Berquin acknowledge his
error?'—'Yes, certainly,' answered the monk, 'and
I doubt not that his soul departed in peace.' This
man was Montius; he wrote and told the anecdote to
Erasmus. 'I do not believe a word of it,' answered
the latter. 'It is the usual story which those people
invent after the death of their victims, in order to
appease the anger of the people.'</p>

<p>Some such stratagems were necessary, for the general
agitation was increasing. Berquin's innocence,
stamped on his features and on all his words, struck
those who saw him die, and they were beginning to
murmur. The monks noticed this, and had prepared
themselves beforehand in case the indignation of the
people should break out. They penetrated into the
thickest of the crowd, making presents to the children
and to the common people; and having worked them
up, they sent them off in every direction. The impressionable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
crowd spread over the Grève and through
the neighbouring streets, shouting out that Berquin
was a heretic. Yet here and there men gathered in
little groups, talking of the excellent man who had
been sacrificed to the passion of the theological
faculty. 'Alas!' said some with tears in their eyes,
'there never was a more virtuous man.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_119" id="Ref_119" href="#Foot_119">[119]</a></span>
Many were astonished that a nobleman who held a high
place in the king's affections should be strangled like
a criminal. 'Alas!' rejoined others indignantly, 'what
caused his ruin was the liberty which animated him,
which is always the faithful companion of a good
conscience.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_120" id="Ref_120" href="#Foot_120">[120]</a></span>
Others of more spirit exclaimed: 'Condemn,
quarter, crucify, burn, behead ... that is what
pirates and tyrants can do; but God is the only just
judge, and blessed is the man whom he pardoneth.'
The more pious looked for consolation to the future.
'It is only through the cross,' they said, 'that Christ
will triumph in this kingdom.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_121" id="Ref_121" href="#Foot_121">[121]</a></span>
The crowd dispersed.</p>

<p class="side">=THE MARTYRS' HYMN.=</p>

<p>The news of this tragedy soon spread through
France, everywhere causing the deepest sorrow. Berquin
was not the only person struck down; other
christians also suffered the last punishment. Philip
Huaut was burnt alive, after having his tongue cut
out; and Francis Desus had both hand and head cut
off. The story of these deaths, especially that of Berquin,
was told in the shops of the workmen and in the
cottages of the peasants. Many were terrified at it;
but more than one evangelical christian, when he heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
the tale at his own fireside, raised his head and cast a
look towards heaven, expressive of his joy at having a
Redeemer and a <i>Father's house</i> beyond the sky. 'We
too are ready,' said these men and women of the
Reformation to one another, 'we are ready to meet
death cheerfully, setting our eyes on the life that is
to come.' One of these christian souls, who had
known Berquin best, and who shed most tears over
him, was the Queen of Navarre. Distressed and
alarmed by his death and by the deaths of the christians
sacrificed in other places for the Gospel, she
prayed fervently to God to come to the help of his
people. She called to mind these words of the Gospel:
<i>Shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and
night unto him?</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_122" id="Ref_122" href="#Foot_122">[122]</a></span>
A stranger to all hatred, free from
every evil desire of revenge, she called to the Lord's
remembrance how dear the safety of his children is to
him, and implored his protection for them:</p>

<p>This little poem by the Queen of Navarre, which
contains several other verses, was the martyrs' hymn
in the sixteenth century. Nothing shows more clearly
that she was heart and soul with the evangelicals.</p>

<p>Terror reigned among the reformed christians for
some time after Berquin's martyrdom. They endured
reproach, without putting themselves forward; they
did not wish to irritate their enemies, and many of
them retired to <i>the desert</i>, that is, to some unknown
hiding-place. It was during this period of sorrow
and alarm, when the adversaries imagined that by
getting rid of Berquin they had got rid of the Reformation
as well, and when the remains of the noble
martyr were hardly scattered to the winds of heaven,
that Calvin once more took up his abode in Paris,
not far from the spot where his friend had been burnt.
Rome thought she had put the reformer to death;
but he was about to rise again from his ashes, more
spiritual, more clear, and more powerful, to labour at
the renovation of society and the salvation of mankind.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">FIRST LABOURS OF CALVIN AT PARIS.<br />
 (1529.)</span></h3>

<p class="side">=CALVIN REVISITS NOYON.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">CALVIN, having bid farewell to the towns and
châteaux of Berry, had arrived in the midst of
those hills and plains, those green pastures and noble
forests, which stretch along both sides of the Oise.
He approached that little city of Noyon, which had
been one time the capital of the empire of Charlemagne,
and where Hugues Capet, the head of the third race,
had been elected king. But his thoughts were not
on these things: he was thinking of his father. As
soon as he caught a glimpse of that beautiful Gothic
cathedral, beneath whose shadow he had been brought
up, he said to himself that its pavement would
never more be trodden by his father's feet. He
had never before returned to Noyon in such deep
emotion. The death of Berquin, the death of his
father, the future of the Church and of himself—all
oppressed him. He found consolation in the affection
of his family, and especially in the devoted attachment
of his brother Anthony and of his sister Mary, who
were one day to share his exile. Bowed down by
so many afflictions, he would have sunk under the
burden, 'like a man half dead, if God had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
revived his courage while comforting him by his
Word.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_124" id="Ref_124" href="#Foot_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>His father—that old man with mind so positive, with
hand so firm, and whose authority he had venerated—was
not there to guide him: he was free. Gerard
had decided that his son should devote himself to
the law, by which he might rise to a high position in
the world. Calvin aspired, indeed, to another future,
but from obedience he had renounced his most ardent
desires; and now, finding himself at liberty, he turned
towards that christian career in which he was to be,
along with Luther, the greatest champion of modern
times. 'Earthly fathers,' he said on one occasion,
'must not prevent the supreme and only Father of all
from enjoying his rights.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_125" id="Ref_125" href="#Foot_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>As yet, however, Calvin did not meditate becoming
a reformer in the same sense as Luther. At that time
he would have liked to see all the Church transformed,
rather than set himself apart and build up a
new one. The faith which he desired to preach was
that old christian truth which Paul had preached at
Rome. The scribes had substituted for it the false
traditions of man, but this was only one reason the
more for proclaiming in the Church the doctrine which
had founded the Church. After the first phase of
christian life, in which man thinks only of Christ,
there usually comes a second, where the christian
does not voluntarily worship with assemblies opposed
to his convictions. Calvin was now in the first of
these phases. He thought only of preaching the Gospel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
Did he not possess a pulpit in this very neighbourhood,
and was it not his duty to glorify God from
it? Had it been in his power, he would have done so
in St. Peter's at Rome; why, then, should he refrain
in his own church?</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S PROMOTION AND PREACHING.=</p>

<p>Calvin had friends in Picardy, even among the dignitaries
of the clergy. Early attached to their young
fellow-townsman, these men had received him with joy;
they had found him more advanced in piety and learning,
and had observed nothing in him opposed to their
opinions. They thought that he might become one of
the pillars of the Church. The circumstance that he
had studied the law did not check them; it rendered
him, in their eyes, fitter still to maintain the interests
of the faith ... and of the clergy. Far from repelling
him, his former patrons endeavoured to bind him still
closer to them. That noble friend of his boyhood,
Claude de Hangest of Momor, now abbot of St. Eloy,
offered to give him the living of Pont L'Evêque in exchange
for that of St. Martin of Marteville. Calvin,
seeing in this offer the opportunity of preaching in the
very place where his ancestors had lived, accepted;
and then resigned, in favour of his brother Anthony,
the chapel of La Gésine, of which he had been titulary
for eight years. The act is dated the 30th of April,
1529.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_126" id="Ref_126" href="#Foot_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>The same persons who presided over these several
changes encouraged Calvin to preach. When a young
man who has gone through his studies for the ministry
of the Word returns to his native place, every one is
anxious to hear him. Curiosity was still more keenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
aroused in Calvin's case, for his reputation had preceded
him, and some little charge of heresy, put forward
from time to time, served but to increase the
general eagerness. Everybody wanted to hear the
son of the episcopal secretary, the cooper's grandson.
The men and women who knew him hastened to the
church; people even came from Noyon. The holy
place was soon filled. At last a young man, of middle
height, with thin pale face, whose eyes indicated firm
conviction and lively zeal, went up into the pulpit
and explained the Holy Scriptures to his fellow-townsmen.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_127" id="Ref_127" href="#Foot_127">[127]</a></span>
The effects of Calvin's preaching were
various. Many persons rejoiced to hear, at last, a
living word beneath that roof which had reechoed
with so much vain and useless babbling. Of this number
were, no doubt, certain notable men who were seen
pressing round the preacher: Laurent of Normandy,
who enjoyed great consideration in that district;
Christopher Lefèvre, Lancelot of Montigny, Jacques
Bernardy, Corneille de Villette, Nicholas Néret,
Labbé surnamed Balafré, Claude Dupré, and Nicholas
Picot, Anthony Calvin's brother-in-law. All were
afterwards accused of having embraced the new doctrine,
and were condemned by the parliament of Paris
to be drawn on hurdles and burnt in the great square
of Noyon; but they had already quitted the kingdom.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_128" id="Ref_128" href="#Foot_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The words of the young speaker did not merely
communicate fresh knowledge—they worked a transformation
of the heart and life. But there were men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
present quite ready to receive certain evangelical ideas,
who yet did not mean to change either their life or their
heart. The same word thus produced faith in some
and opposition in others: it <i>divided the light from the
darkness</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_129" id="Ref_129" href="#Foot_129">[129]</a></span>
Certain bigots and priests, in particular,
inveighed against the preaching of that serious-looking,
earnest young man, and exclaimed: 'They are setting
wolves to guard the sheep!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_130" id="Ref_130" href="#Foot_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=DECIDES ON GOING TO PARIS.=</p>

<p>Calvin stayed only two or three months at Noyon.
Perhaps a growing opposition forced him to depart.
He desired also to continue his Greek studies; but
instead of returning to Orleans or Bourges, he resolved
to go to Paris. The moment was favourable. Classical
studies were at that time making great progress in the
capital. Francis I., at the request of Budæus and
Du Bellay, had just founded (1529) several professorships
for teaching Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. It was
a complete revolution, and Paris was full of animation
when Calvin arrived. The fantastical framework
which the scholastics, theologians, jurists, and philosophers
had erected during the middle ages, fell to the
ground in the midst of jeering and laughter, and the
modern learning arose amid the unanimous applause of
the rising generation. Pierre Danès, a pupil of Budæus
and Lascaris, and afterwards a bishop, taught
Greek;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_131" id="Ref_131" href="#Foot_131">[131]</a></span>
Francis Vatable introduced young scholars
to the knowledge of the Hebrew Scriptures, although
he failed himself to find the counsel of God therein;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_132" id="Ref_132" href="#Foot_132">[132]</a></span>
other illustrious professors completed this precious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
course of instruction. Paris was a centre whence light
emanated; and this was the reason which induced
Calvin to forsake Noyon, Bourges, and even Orleans,
and hasten his steps thither.</p>

<p>The journey was a painful one; Calvin (whether on
horseback or on foot is unknown) arrived in Paris
about the end of June, quite worn out with fatigue.
'It is impossible,' he said next morning, 'for me to go
out of doors;'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_133" id="Ref_133" href="#Foot_133">[133]</a></span>
indeed, he did not leave his room for
four days. But the news of his arrival soon spread;
his friends and admirers hastened to his inn, and
during these four days his room was never empty.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_134" id="Ref_134" href="#Foot_134">[134]</a></span>
All the agitation of the schools seemed to be transported
thither.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S VISITORS.=</p>

<p>They talked of Budæus, Vatable, and Danès, of
Greek and Hebrew, and of the sun of learning then
shining over the old Lutetia.... Calvin listened and
learnt the state of men's minds. One of the first who
hurried to him was Coiffard, his fellow-collegian at
Orleans, who brought his father with him. People
contended for the student of Noyon, who had already
become celebrated. 'Come and stay with us,' said
the young Parisian; and when Calvin declined, 'I entreat
you,' said Coiffard in the most affectionate manner,
'to grant me this favour.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_135" id="Ref_135" href="#Foot_135">[135]</a></span>
The father also
insisted, for the worthy citizen knew what a steady
friend his rather frivolous son would find in the
Picardin student. 'There is nothing in the world
I desire so much,' he said, 'as to see you associate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
with my son.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_136" id="Ref_136" href="#Foot_136">[136]</a></span>
—'Come, do come,' urged the son,
'and be my companion.' Calvin was touched by this
affection; but he feared the interruptions of the family,
its distance from college, and he had but one object—study.
'I would accept your offer with both hands,' he
said, 'but that I intend to follow Danès' Greek course,
and his school is too far from your house.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_137" id="Ref_137" href="#Foot_137">[137]</a></span>
The father and son went away greatly disappointed.</p>

<p>Not long after this, a more important personage
entered the room. It was Nicholas Cop, professor at
St. Barbe, whose father, a native of Basle, had just
been appointed physician to the king. Both father
and son were strongly suspected of belonging to the
'new opinions;' but at that time Francis cared little
about them. The elder Cop had translated Galen
and Hippocrates, and the king had confided to him
the care of his health. A strict friendship erelong
united Calvin and the son. The latter, although a
professor in the university, listened to the student of
Noyon as a disciple listens to his master; it is one of
those marks of Calvin's superiority, which every one
recognised instantly. He showed his friend 'how
Christ discharges the office of physician, since he is
sent by the Father to quicken the dead.'</p>

<p>The conversations which these two young men
then held together resulted in after years in an event
which exercised a certain influence over the destiny
of the reformer and of the Reform itself.</p>

<p class="side">=VISIT TO A CONVENT.=</p>

<p>An object of less importance occupied them now:
it was Calvin's first business in Paris, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
account he gives of it throws a new light on the
future legislator. The custom of shutting up in
convents the young persons who had any tendency
towards the Gospel had already begun. 'Our friend
Daniel, the advocate,' said Calvin to Cop, 'has a sister
in a nunnery at Paris; she is about to take the veil,
and Daniel wishes to know if it is with her full consent.'—'I
will accompany you,' said the professor,
and on the following Sunday, Calvin having recovered
from his fatigue, the two friends set out for the convent.
The future reformer, who was already opposed
to monastic vows, especially when taken under constraint,
cleverly devised a plan for learning whether
any restriction was placed upon the young lady's
liberty. 'Converse with the abbess,' he said to Cop,
as they were going to the nunnery, 'and contrive
that I may be able to talk privately with our friend's
sister.' The abbess, followed by the girl, entered the
parlour. 'We have granted her,' said the former,
'the privilege of taking the solemn vows.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_138" id="Ref_138" href="#Foot_138">[138]</a></span>
According
to his instructions Cop began to talk with the
superior on different subjects which had no connection
with the matter in hand. During this time,
Calvin, who believed he saw a victim before him,
took advantage of the opportunity, and said to Daniel's
sister: 'Are you taking this yoke upon you willingly,
or is it placed on your neck by force?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_139" id="Ref_139" href="#Foot_139">[139]</a></span>
Do not fear
to trust me with the thoughts that disturb you.' The
girl looked at Calvin with a thoughtless air, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
answered him with much volubility: 'The veil is
what I most desire, and the day when I shall make
my vow can never come too soon.' The future reformer
was astonished: he had before him a giddy
young person, who had been led to believe that she
would find great amusement in the cloister. 'Every
time she spoke of her vows,' said Calvin, 'you might
have fancied she was playing with her doll.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_140" id="Ref_140" href="#Foot_140">[140]</a></span>
He desired, however, to address one serious word to her:
'Mademoiselle,' he said to her, 'I beg of you not to
trust too much to your own strength: I conjure you
to promise nothing as if you could accomplish it yourself.
Lean rather on the strength of God, in whom
we live and have our being.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_141" id="Ref_141" href="#Foot_141">[141]</a></span>
Perhaps Calvin
thought that by speaking so seriously to the young
girl, she would renounce her rash undertaking; but
he was mistaken.</p>

<p>He returned to his inn, and two days after (the
25th of June) he wrote to Daniel an account of his visit
to the convent. Having finished, he was beginning
another letter to a canon of Orleans,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_142" id="Ref_142" href="#Foot_142">[142]</a></span>
when one of
his friends arrived, who had come to take him for a
ride. We might suppress this incident as being of no
importance; but it is perhaps also an unexpected feature
in Calvin's habits. He is generally represented
as absorbed in his books or reprimanding the disorderly.
And yet he was no stranger to the decent
relaxations of life: he could ride on horseback and
took pleasure in the exercise. He accepted his friend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
Viermey's offer. 'I shall finish the letter on my return,'
he said,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_143" id="Ref_143" href="#Foot_143">[143]</a></span>
and the two students set off on their
excursion in the neighbourhood of Paris. A few
days later Calvin hired a room in the college of
Fortret, where he was near the professors, and resumed
his study of languages, law, and philosophy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_144" id="Ref_144" href="#Foot_144">[144]</a></span>
He desired to learn. Having received the knowledge
of divine things, he wished to acquire a true
understanding of the world.</p>

<p>But erelong the summons from on high sounded
louder than ever in his heart. When he was in his
room, surrounded by his law books, the voice of his
conscience cried to him that he ought to study the
Bible. When he went out, all his friends who felt a
love for pure religion begged of him to devote himself
to the Gospel.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_145" id="Ref_145" href="#Foot_145">[145]</a></span>
Calvin was one of those fortresses
that are not to be taken at the first assault. As he
looked upon the books scattered about his study, he
could not make up his mind to forsake them. But
whenever in the course of his life God spoke clearly
to him, he repressed his fondest desires. Thus urged
from within and from without, he yielded at last. 'I
renounce all other sciences,' he said, 'and give myself
up entirely to theology and to God.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_146" id="Ref_146" href="#Foot_146">[146]</a></span>
This news
spread among the secret assemblies of the faithful,
and all were filled with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>A mighty movement had taken place in Calvin's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
soul; but it must be understood that there was no
plan laid down in his mind. He had no ambition, no
art, no <i>rôle</i>; but he did with a strong will whatever
God set before him. The time he now spent in Paris
was his apprenticeship. Having given himself to
God, he set to work with the decision of an energetic
character and the firmness of a persevering mind.
He studied theology with enthusiasm. 'The science
of God is the mistress-science,' he said; 'the others
are only her servants.' He gave consistency to that
little chosen band who, in the midst of the crowd
of scholars, turned lovingly towards the Holy Scriptures.
He excited young and noble minds; he studied
with them and endeavoured to explain their
difficulties.</p>

<p class="side">=SPEAKS AT SECRET MEETINGS.=</p>

<p>He did more. Berquin's death had struck all his
friends with terror. 'If they have burnt this green
wood,' said some, 'they will not spare the dry.'
Calvin, not permitting himself to be checked by these
alarms, began to explore that city which had become
so dangerous. He joined the secret assemblies
which met under the shadow of night in remote
quarters,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_147" id="Ref_147" href="#Foot_147">[147]</a></span>
where he explained the Scriptures with
a clearness and energy of which none had ever
heard the like. These meetings were held more particularly
on the left bank of the Seine, in that part of
the city which the catholics afterwards termed <i>Little
Geneva</i>, and which, on the other hand, is now the
seat of Parisian catholicism. One day the evangelicals
would repair mysteriously to a house on the property
of the abbey of St. Germain des Prés; another day
they would meet in the precincts of the university,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
the <i>quartier latin</i> of our times. In the room would be a
few wooden benches, on which the poor people, a few
students, and sometimes one or two men of learning,
took their seats. They loved that simple-hearted
young man, who so effectually introduced into their
minds and hearts the truths he found in the Scriptures.
'The Word of Christ is always a fire,' they
said; 'but when he explains it, this fire shines out
with unusual brilliancy.'</p>

<p>Young men formed themselves on his model; but
there were many who rushed into controversy, instead
of seeking edification as Calvin did. In the university
quarter the pupils of Daniel and Vatable might
be seen, with the Hebrew or Greek Testaments in
their hands, disputing with everybody. 'It is thus
in the Hebrew text,' they said; 'and the Greek text
reads so and so.' Calvin did not, however, disdain
polemics; following the natural bent of his mind, he
attacked error and reprimanded the guilty. Some
who were astonished at his language asked: 'Is not
this the curé of Pont l'Evêque, the friend of Monseigneur
de St. Eloy?' But, not allowing himself
to be checked by these words, he confounded alike
the superstitious papists and the incredulous innovators.
'He was wholly given up to divinity and to
God, to the great delight of all believers.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_148" id="Ref_148" href="#Foot_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=HE CIRCULATES INFORMATION.=</p>

<p>It was already possible to distinguish in him, in
some features at least, the character of chief of the
Reform. As he possessed great facility of correspondence,
he kept himself informed, and others also,
of all that was passing in the christian world. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
made about this time a collection of papers and documents
relating to the most recent facts of the Reformation,
and sent them to Duchemin, but not for
him to keep.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_149" id="Ref_149" href="#Foot_149">[149]</a></span>
'I send them to you on this condition,'
wrote Calvin, 'that, in accordance with your
good faith and duty, they may pass through your
hands to our friends.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_150" id="Ref_150" href="#Foot_150">[150]</a></span>
To this packet he added
an epitome,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_151" id="Ref_151" href="#Foot_151">[151]</a></span>
some commentaries, and a collection of
notes made probably by Roussel during his residence
at Strasburg. He purposed adding an appendix:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_152" id="Ref_152" href="#Foot_152">[152]</a></span>'But I had no time,' he said.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_153" id="Ref_153" href="#Foot_153">[153]</a></span>
Calvin desired that
all the friends of the Gospel should profit by the
light which he himself possessed. He brought the new
ideas and new writings into circulation. A close
student, an indefatigable evangelist, this young man
of twenty was, by his far-seeing glance, almost a
reformer.</p>

<p>He did not confine his labours to Paris, Orleans,
Bourges, or Noyon: the city of Meaux occupied his
attention. Meaux, which had welcomed Lefèvre and
Farel, which had heard Leclerc, the first martyr, still
possessed Briçonnet. This former protector of the
evangelicals would indeed no longer see them, and
appeared absorbed in the honours and seductions of
the prelacy. But some men thought that at the bottom
of his heart he still loved the Gospel. What a triumph
if the grace of God should once more blossom in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
soul! Daniel had friends at Meaux; Calvin begged
of him to open the door (or, to use his own expression,
<i>the window</i>) of this city for him. In the number of
these friends was a certain <i>Mæcenas</i>. The young
doctor, writing from Meaux, gives a portrait of this
individual which exactly fits the bishop. He does
not name Briçonnet; but as he often suppresses names,
or employs either initials or pseudonyms, we might
almost say that the name was not necessary here.
Daniel accordingly wrote to Mæcenas, who returned
a very cold answer.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_154" id="Ref_154" href="#Foot_154">[154]</a></span>
'I cannot walk with those
people,' he said; 'I cannot conform my manners to
theirs.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_155" id="Ref_155" href="#Foot_155">[155]</a></span>
Daniel insisted; but it was all of no use:
the timid Mæcenas would on no account have anything
to do with Calvin. Briçonnet, we learn, was
surrounded by friends who were continually repeating
to him: 'A bishop ought to have no commerce with
persons suspected of innovation.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_156" id="Ref_156" href="#Foot_156">[156]</a></span>
Calvin, animated
by the noblest ambition, that of bringing back to God
a soul that was going astray, finding himself denied
every time he knocked at the gate of this great personage,
at last gave up his generous enterprise, and,
shaking the dust from his feet, he said with severity:
'Since he will not be with us, let him take pleasure in
himself, and with a heart full, or rather inflated by his
own importance, let him pamper his ambition.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_157" id="Ref_157" href="#Foot_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></div>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S MISSIONARY ZEAL.=</p>

<p>Calvin did not, however, fail completely at Meaux:
'You have given me prompt and effectual aid,' he
wrote to Daniel; 'you have opened me a window,
and have thus given me the privilege of being in future
an indiscreet petitioner.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_158" id="Ref_158" href="#Foot_158">[158]</a></span>
He took advantage of this
opening to propagate the Gospel. 'I will do it,' he
said, 'without imprudence or precipitation.' And,
calling to mind that 'the doctrine of Christ is like
old wine, which has ceased working, but which nevertheless
gives nourishment to the body,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_159" id="Ref_159" href="#Foot_159">[159]</a></span>
he busied
himself in filling vessels with this precious drink: 'I
will take care,' he wrote to Daniel, 'that the inside
shall be well filled with wine.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_160" id="Ref_160" href="#Foot_160">[160]</a></span>
He ended his
letter by saying: 'I want the <i>Odyssey</i> of Homer
which I lent Sucquet: pray tell him so.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_161" id="Ref_161" href="#Foot_161">[161]</a></span>
Luther
took Plautus and Terence into the convent with him;
Calvin asked for Homer.</p>

<p>He soon returned to Paris, which opened a wider
field of labour to him. On the 15th of January, 1530,
he wrote Daniel a letter which he dated from the
<i>Acropolis</i>, as if Paris were to him the citadel of catholicism
or the Parthenon of France.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_162" id="Ref_162" href="#Foot_162">[162]</a></span>
He was always
trying to save some lost sheep, and such a desire filled
his mind on the 15th of January. On that day he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
expected two friends to dinner. One of them, Robert
Daniel, brother to the advocate of Orleans, an enthusiastic
young man, was burning with desire to see the
world. Calvin, who had already done all in his power
to win him over, flattered himself that he would succeed
that day; but the giddy young fellow, suspecting
perhaps what awaited him, did not come. Calvin sent
a messenger to Robert's lodging. 'He has decamped,'
said the landlord; 'he has left for Italy.' At Meaux
Calvin had desired to win over a great personage; at
Paris he had hoped to win over a young adventurer:
in both cases he failed. 'Alas!' he said, 'I am but
a dry and useless log!' And once more he sought
fresh strength in Christ.</p>

<p class="side">=BEDA ATTACKS THE PROFESSORS.=</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Sorbonne, proud of the victory it had
gained in bringing Berquin to the stake, decided to
pursue its triumphs. The war was about to begin
again. It was Beda who renewed the combat—that
Beda of whom Erasmus said: 'There are three thousand
priests in that man alone!' He did not attack Calvin,
disdaining, or rather ignoring him. He aimed at
higher game, and having triumphed over one of the
king's gentlemen, he attacked the doctors whom Francis
had invited to Paris for the propagation of learning.
Danès, Vatable, and others having been cited before
the parliament, the fiery syndic rose and said: 'The
king's doctors neglect Aristotle, and study the Holy
Scriptures only.... If people continue to occupy themselves
with Greek and Hebrew, it is all over with faith.
These folks desire to explain the Bible, and they are
not even theologians!... The Greek and Hebrew
books of the Holy Scriptures come mostly from Germany,
where they may have been altered. Many of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
the persons who print Hebrew books are Jews.... It
is not, therefore, a sufficient argument to say: It is
so and so in the Hebrew.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_163" id="Ref_163" href="#Foot_163">[163]</a></span>
These doctors ought to
be forbidden to interfere with Holy Scripture in their
courses; or at least they should be ordered first to
undergo an examination at the university.' The king's
professors did not hold back in the cause of knowledge.
They boldly assumed the offensive. 'If the
university of Paris is now in small esteem among
foreign nations,' they said to the parliament, 'it is because
instead of applying themselves to the study of
the Holy Gospels and of the ancient fathers—Cyprian,
Chrysostom, Jerome, and Augustin—its theologians
substitute for this true knowledge a science teaching
nothing but craft and sophistry. It is not thus that
God wills to enlighten his people. We must study
sacred literature, and drink freely of all the treasures
of the human mind.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_164" id="Ref_164" href="#Foot_164">[164]</a></span>
Beda had gone too far. At
court, and even in parliament, numerous voices were
raised in behalf of learning and learned men. Parliament
dismissed the charges of the syndic of the Sorbonne.</p>

<p>The exasperated Beda now employed all his eloquence
to get the professors condemned by the Sorbonne.
'The new doctors,' he exclaimed, 'horrible
to say! pretend that Holy Scripture cannot be understood
without Greek, Hebrew, and other such languages.'
On the 30th of April, 1530, the Sorbonne
did actually condemn as rash and scandalous the proposition
of the professors which Beda had denounced.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_165" id="Ref_165" href="#Foot_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></div>

<p class="side">=SMALL BEGINNINGS OF A GREAT WORK.=</p>

<p>Calvin anxiously observed in all its phases this
struggle between his teachers and the doctors of the
Sorbonne. All the students were on the watch, as
was Calvin also in his college; and when the decision
of the parliament became known there, it was received
with loud acclamations. While the Sorbonne placed
itself on the side of tradition, Calvin placed himself
still more decidedly on the side of Scripture. He
thought that as the oral teaching of the apostles had
ceased, their written teaching had become its indispensable
substitute. The writings of Matthew and John,
of Peter and Paul, were, in his opinion, the living
word of these great doctors, their teaching for those
ages which could neither see nor hear them. It
appeared to Calvin as impossible to reform the Church
without the writings of the apostles, as it would have
been to form it in the first century without their
preaching. He saw clearly that if the Church was to
be renewed, it must be done by faith and by Scripture—a
twofold principle which at bottom is but one.</p>

<p>But the hour had not yet come when Calvin was to
proclaim these great truths with the authority of a
reformer. A modest and devout man, he was now
performing a more humble work in the remotest
streets and loneliest houses of the capital. One would
have taken him for the most insignificant of men,
and yet he was already a conqueror. The light of
Scripture, with which his mind was saturated, was
one day to shine like the lightning from east to west;
and no man since St. Paul was to hold the Gospel torch
so high and with so firm a hand. When that student,
so thin, pale, and obscure, in appearance so mean, in
manner so timid, passed down the street of St. Jacques
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
or of the Sorbonne; when he crept silently past the
houses, and slipped unobserved into one of them,
bearing with him the Word of life, there was not even
an old woman that noticed him. And yet the time
was to come when Francis I., with his policy, conquests,
priests, court, and festivities, would only call up
frivolous or disgusting recollections; while the work
which this poor scholar was by God's grace then beginning,
would increase day by day for the salvation
of souls and prosperity of nations, and would advance
calmly but surely to the conquest of the world.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">MARGARET'S SORROWS AND THE FESTIVITIES OF THE COURT<br />
 (1530-1531.)</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN was France to turn herself towards the
Word of God? At the time of her brother's
return from his Spanish captivity, Margaret had
solicited him to grant liberty of preaching the Gospel,
and the king, as will be remembered, had deferred
the matter until his sons were restored to
freedom. That moment seemed to have arrived.
In order to recover his children, Francis had sacrificed
at Cambray (June 1529), in <i>the Ladies' Peace</i>,
the towns he had conquered, the allies who had
been faithful to him, and two millions of crowns besides.</p>

<p>It was not, however, until ten months later that the
children of France returned. All the royal family
hurried to the Spanish frontier to receive them; all,
except Margaret. 'As it would be difficult to take
you further without danger,' said her mother, 'the
king and I have determined to leave you behind for
your confinement.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_166" id="Ref_166" href="#Foot_166">[166]</a></span>
Margaret, uneasy and perhaps
a little jealous, wrote to Montmorency: 'When the
King of Navarre is with you, I pray you to advise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
him; but I much fear that you will not be able
to prevent his falling in love with the Spanish
ladies.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_167" id="Ref_167" href="#Foot_167">[167]</a></span>
At the beginning of July the king's children
were restored to their father; Margaret was
transported with joy, and showed it by her enthusiastic
letters to Francis I.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_168" id="Ref_168" href="#Foot_168">[168]</a></span>
She loved these princes
like a mother. More serious thoughts soon filled her
mind: the epoch fixed by her brother had arrived, but
would he keep his promise?</p>

<p class="side">=MARGARET PROMOTES UNITY.=</p>

<p>Margaret lost no time. Being left alone at Blois,
she endeavoured to strengthen the good cause, and
carried on an active correspondence with the leaders
of the Reform. 'Alas!' said the priests, 'while King
Francis is labouring to protect his kingdom from the
inundations of the Rhine (that is, the Reformation),
his sister the Queen of Navarre is trying to break the
dykes and throw down the embankments.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_169" id="Ref_169" href="#Foot_169">[169]</a></span>
There
was one work above all which Margaret had at heart;
she wished to put an end to the divisions among
the evangelicals. She entreated the Frenchmen who
were at Strasburg, 'waiting for the consolation of
Israel,' to do all in their power to terminate the disunion;
she even commanded Bucer to do so.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_170" id="Ref_170" href="#Foot_170">[170]</a></span>
Bucer's
fine talents, benevolent character, and cultivated understanding,
the eloquence of his language, the dignity
of his carriage, the captivating sound of his voice, his
discerning of spirits, his ardent zeal—all seemed to
fit him for a peace-maker. He set to work without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
delay, and informed Luther of the princess's injunctions.
'If our opinions are compared with yours,' he
said, 'it will be easily seen that they are radically the
same, although expressed in different terms. Let us
not furnish our enemies with a weapon with which to
attack truth.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_171" id="Ref_171" href="#Foot_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>If Margaret had confidence in Bucer, he too had confidence
in her. He admired the sincerity of her faith,
the liveliness of her piety, the purity of her manners,
the beauty of her understanding, the charms of her
conversation, and the abundance of her good works.
'Never was this christian heroine found wanting in
her duty,' he wrote to Luther.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_172" id="Ref_172" href="#Foot_172">[172]</a></span>
The Strasburgers
thought that if Luther and the Germans on one side,
and Margaret and the French on the other, were united,
the cause of the Reformation would be triumphant in
Europe. Whenever any good news arrived from
France, Bucer thrilled with joy; he ran to communicate
it to Capito, to Hedion, to Zell, and to Hohenlohe;
and then he wrote to Luther: 'The brethren write to
us from France, dear doctor, that the Gospel is spreading
among them in a wonderful manner. A great number
of the nobility have already received the truth.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_173" id="Ref_173" href="#Foot_173">[173]</a></span>
There is a certain district in Normandy where the
Gospel is spread so widely that the enemy call it <i>Little
Germany</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_174" id="Ref_174" href="#Foot_174">[174]</a></span>
The king is no stranger to the good
doctrine;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_175" id="Ref_175" href="#Foot_175">[175]</a></span>
and as his children are now at liberty, he
will no longer pay such regard to what the pope and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
the emperor demand. Christ will soon be publicly
confessed over the whole kingdom.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_176" id="Ref_176" href="#Foot_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=DEATH OF MARGARET'S CHILD.=</p>

<p>The Queen of Navarre was obliged to discontinue
her correspondence with the reformers of Germany;
great joys and great anguish gave another direction
to her thoughts. About a fortnight after the return
of the children of France, Margaret became the
mother of a fine boy at the castle of Blois. When
the king passed through that place on his return from
the Pyrenees, he took his sister with him, after her
churching, to Fontainebleau. But erelong bad tidings
of her child summoned Margaret to Alençon, where
he was staying with his nurse; he died on Christmas
day, 1530, at the age of five months and a half. The
mother who had watched near him, who had felt his
sweet breath upon her cheek, saw him now lying dead
in his little cradle, and could not turn away her eyes
from him. At one time she thought he would revive,
but alas! he was really dead. The queen felt as if
her life had been torn from her; her strength was
exhausted; her heart bled, but God consoled her.
'I place him,' she said, 'in the arms of his Father;'
and as she felt the necessity of giving glory to God
publicly, she sent for one of her principal officers, and,
with a voice stifled by tears and sighs, ordered that the
child's death should be posted up in the principal
quarters of the city, and that these words should be
at the foot of the notice:</p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smc">The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.</span></p>

<p>A sentiment of joy mingled, however, with her inexpressible
sorrow; and, confident that the little child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
was in the presence of God, the pious mother ordered
a <i>Te Deum</i> to be sung.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_177" id="Ref_177" href="#Foot_177">[177]</a></span>
'I entreat you both,' she
wrote to her brother and to her mother, 'to <i>rejoice at
his glory</i>, and not give way to any sadness.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_178" id="Ref_178" href="#Foot_178">[178]</a></span>
Francis,
who had not long before lost two daughters, was moved
at this solemn circumstance, and replied to his sister:
'You have borne the grief of mine, as if they were
your own lost children; now I must bear yours, as if
it were my own loss. It is the third of yours and
the last of mine, whom God has called away to his
blessed communion, acquired by them with little
labour, and desired by us with such great travail.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_179" id="Ref_179" href="#Foot_179">[179]</a></span>
There are afflictions from God which awaken deep
feelings, even in the most frivolous hearts, and lips
which are ordinarily dumb sometimes utter harmonious
sounds in the presence of death. Other consolations
were not wanting to the queen. Du Bellay,
at that time Bishop of Bayonne, and afterwards of
Paris, hastened to Alençon: 'Ah!' said Margaret,
'but for our Lord's help, the burden would have been
more than I could bear.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_180" id="Ref_180" href="#Foot_180">[180]</a></span>
The bishop urged her,
on the part of the king, to go to St. Germain, where
preparations were making for the coronation of Queen
Eleanor, the emperor's sister. Margaret, who always
obeyed her brother's orders, quitted Alençon, though
with sorrow, in order to be present at his marriage.</p>

<p class="side">=MARRIAGE OF FRANCIS AND ELEANOR.=</p>

<p>The court had never been more brilliant. The less
happiness there was in this marriage, the more pomp
the king desired to display; joy of the heart was replaced
by the sound of the fife and drum and of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
hautboy. The dresses were glittering, the festivities
magnificent.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">There were mysteries and games, and the streets were gaily drest,</div>
<div class="verse">And the roads with flowers were strewn of the sweetest and the best;</div>
<div class="verse">On every side were galleries, and, if 't would pleasure yield,</div>
<div class="verse">We'd have conjured up again for thee a new Elysian field.<span
                   class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_181" id="Ref_181" href="#Foot_181">[181]</a></span></div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Princes, archbishops, bishops, barons, knights, gentlemen
of parliament, and the magistrates of the city,
were assembled for this illustrious marriage; scholars
and poets were not wanting. Francis I. would often
repeat the proverb addressed by Fouquet, Count of
Anjou, to Louis IV.:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">Un roi non lettré</div>
<div class="verse">Est un âne couronné.<span
                   class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_182" id="Ref_182" href="#Foot_182">[182]</a></span></div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Philologers, painters, and architects had flocked to
France from foreign countries. They had met in Paris
men worthy to receive them. William Budæus, the
three brothers Du Bellay, William Petit, the king's
confessor; William Cop, the friend of Lascaris and
Erasmus; Pierre du Châtel, who so gracefully described
his travels in the East; Pellicier, the learned commentator
on Pliny, whose papers have not, however, been
printed;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_183" id="Ref_183" href="#Foot_183">[183]</a></span>
Peter Danès, whose talents and knowledge
Calvin esteemed so highly: all these scholars,
who entertained sympathies, more or less secret, for
the Reform, were then at court. These men of
letters passed among the Roman party as belonging
to Luther's flock.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_184" id="Ref_184" href="#Foot_184">[184]</a></span>
Somewhat later, indeed, when one
of them, Danès, was at the Council of Trent, a French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
orator inveighed strongly against the lax morals of
Rome. The Bishop of Orvieto said with contempt:
'<i>Gallus cantat!</i>'—'<i>Utinam</i>,' sharply retorted Danès,
then ambassador for France, '<i>utinam ad galli cantum
Petrus resipisceret!</i>'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_185" id="Ref_185" href="#Foot_185">[185]</a></span>
But the cock has often crowed,
and Peter has shed no tears.</p>

<p>In the midst of all these men of letters was</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">Margaret, the fairest flower</div>
<div class="verse">That ever grew on earth,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">as Ronsard called her. But although her fine understanding
enjoyed this select society, more serious
thoughts occupied her mind. She could not forget,
even in the midst of the court, the little angel that
had flown away from her; she was uneasy about the
friends of the Gospel; the worldly festivities around
her left her heart depressed and unsatisfied. She
endeavoured to pierce the thick clouds that hung over
her, and soaring in spirit to the 'heavenly kingdom,'
she grasped the hand that Christ stretched out to her
from on high. She returned to the well of Jacob,
where she had drunk when she was so tired with
her journey. She had been as a parched and weary
land, having neither dew nor moisture, and the Lord
had refreshed her with the clear springs of his
Holy Spirit. 'A continual sprinkling (to use her
own words) kept up in her a heavenly eternity;'
and she would have desired all who gathered round
her to come to that well where she had so effectually
quenched her own thirst. Accordingly, in the midst
of the worldly agitation of the court, and of all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
honours lavished on her rank and her wit, the poor
mother, whose heart was bruised but consoled, looked
out in silence for some lamb which she could recall
from its wandering, and said:</p>

<p>These appeals were not unavailing. The Reformation
was advancing in France by two different roads:
one was on the mountains, the other in the plain.
The Gospel gained hearts among the sons of labour
and of trial; but it gained others also among the
learned and high-born, whose faculty of inquiry had
been aroused, and who desired to substitute truth in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
the place of monastic superstitions. Margaret was
the evangelist of the court and of the king. Her
mother, with Duprat and Montmorency, ruled in the
council-chamber, the Duchess of Etampes in the court
festivities, but the gentle voice of the Queen of Navarre
supported Francis in his frequent periods of
uneasiness and dejection. Yet not to the king alone
did Margaret devote at this time the attentions of her
ardent charity. All the affections of her heart were
just now concentrated on a single object.</p>

<p class="side">=LOUISA OF SAVOY DYING.=</p>

<p>She had not recovered from the death of her child,
when another blow fell upon the Queen of Navarre.
The brilliant and gay festivities of the court were
succeeded by the sullen silence of the grave; and the
icy coldness, which had presided over the marriage of
Francis with his enemy's sister, was followed by the
keen anguish and the bitter sorrows of the tenderest
of daughters. About the end of the year 1531 the
Isle of France was visited by an epidemic. Louisa
of Savoy was taken seriously ill at Fontainebleau,
where the children of the king were staying. Margaret
hurried thither immediately. Louisa, that great
enemy of the Reformation, weakened by her dissolute
life, was suffering from a severe fever, and yet, imagining
that she would not die, she continued to attend to
business of importance, and, between the paroxysms
of the disease that was killing her, dictated her despatches
to the king. Never had mother so depraved
and daughter so virtuous felt such love for each other.
As soon as she saw the Duchess of Angoulême, the
Queen of Navarre anticipated 'the greatest of misfortunes,'
and never left her side. The king's children
afforded their grandmother some diversion. Charles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
Duke of Angoulême, then nine years old, thought
only of his father. 'If I only meet him,' said the
boy one day, 'I will never let go his hand.'—'And
if the king should go to hunt the boar?' said his aunt.—'Well!
I shall not be afraid; papa will be able
to take care of me.'—'When Madame heard these
words,' wrote Margaret to her brother, 'she burst into
tears, which has done her much good.'</p>

<p>In the midst of all these mournful occupations, Margaret
kept watch over the friends of the Gospel. 'Dear
nephew,' she wrote to the grand-master Montmorency,
'that good man Lefèvre writes to me that he is uncomfortable
at Blois, because the folks there are trying
to annoy him. For change of air, he would willingly
go and see a friend of his, if such were the king's good
pleasure.' Margaret, finding that the enemies of the
Reform were tormenting the old man, gave him an
asylum at Nerac in her own states. We shall meet
with him there hereafter.</p>

<p>On the 20th of September, Louisa, feeling a little
better, left Fontainebleau for Romorantin; but she had
hardly reached Grez, near Nemours, when her failing
voice, her labouring breath, and her words so sad
'that no one could listen to them, gave her daughter
a sorrow and vexation impossible to describe.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_187" id="Ref_187" href="#Foot_187">[187]</a></span>
'It is probable that she will die,' wrote Margaret to the
king. Louisa, notwithstanding her weakness, still
busied herself with affairs of state; she wished to die
governing. Deep sorrow filled her daughter's heart.
It was too much for her, this sight of a mother whom
she loved with intense affection, trifling on the brink
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
of the grave, strengthening herself against death by
means of her power and her greatness, 'as if they
would serve her as a rampart and strong tower,'
forgetting that there was another besides herself, who
disposed of that life of which she fancied herself to be
the mistress. Margaret did not rest content with
only praying for her mother; she sat by her and spoke
to her of the Saviour. 'Madame,' she said, 'I entreat
you to fix your hopes elsewhere. Strive to make
God propitious to you.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_188" id="Ref_188" href="#Foot_188">[188]</a></span>
This woman, so ambitious,
clever, false, and dissolute, whose only virtue was
maternal love, does not appear to have opened her
heart to her daughter's voice. She breathed her last
on the 29th of September, 1531, in the arms of the
Queen of Navarre.</p>

<p>Thoughts of a different order were soon to engross
Margaret's attention. Hers was a sincere and living
piety, but she had an excessive fear of contests and
divisions, and, like many eminent persons of that
epoch, she desired at any cost, and even by employing
diplomatic means, to achieve a reform which
should leave catholicity intact. To set before herself
a universal transformation of the Church was certainly
a noble and a christian aim; but Calvin,
Luther, Farel, and others saw that it could only be
attained at the expense of truth. The Queen of
Navarre's fault was her readiness to sacrifice everything
to the realisation of this beautiful dream; and
we shall see what was done in France (Francis lending
himself to it from mere political motives) to attain
the accomplishment of this magnificent but chimerical
project.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">DIPLOMATISTS, BACKSLIDERS, MARTYRS.<br />
 (1531.)</span></h3>

<p class="side">=CHARLES SLANDERS THE PROTESTANTS.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE royal trio was now broken up. Margaret,
knowing well that her mother had always influenced
her brother in favour of popery, hoped to
profit by an event that had cost her so many tears,
and immediately attempted to incline her brother to
the side of the Reform. But there were other influences
at work at court: the Sorbonne, the bishops,
Montmorency, and even the emperor endeavoured
to set Francis against the evangelicals. Charles V.
especially desired to take advantage of the alliance
which drew him closer to France, in order to turn its
sovereign against Luther. His envoy, Noircarmes,
had very positive instructions on this point. One
day, when this ambassador had gone to present his
homage to the king, they had a long conversation
together, and Noircarmes gave utterance to all the
usual calumnies against the Reformation. Francis
did not know what answer to make, but fixed the
diplomatist's accusations in his memory, with the intention
of repeating them to his sister. He paid her
a visit, while still in a state of excitement. 'Madame,'
said he angrily, 'do you know that your friends the
protestants preach the community of goods, the nullity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
of the marriage tie, and the subversion of thrones?
Noircarmes says that if I do not destroy Lutheranism,
my crown will be in danger.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_189" id="Ref_189" href="#Foot_189">[189]</a></span>
To justify the
innocent was one of the tasks which the Queen of
Navarre had imposed upon herself. 'Sire,' she said
to the king, 'the reformers are righteous, learned,
peaceful men, who have no other love than that of
truth, no other aim than the glory of God, and no
other thought than to banish superstition and to correct
morals.' The Queen of Navarre was so gracious,
so true, so eloquent, that the king left her completely
changed—at least for the day.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_190" id="Ref_190" href="#Foot_190">[190]</a></span>
But it was not long
before perfidious insinuations again roused his anger.</p>

<p class="side">=REINHOLD AND THE COURTIERS.=</p>

<p>Margaret, either by her own hand or through her
agents, informed the protestants of Germany of the
charges brought against them by Charles's ambassador,
and called upon them to contradict Noircarmes.
This they did immediately. One of them, Matthew
Reinhold, a man devoted to the Gospel and a clever
diplomatist, arrived in Paris about the middle of
April 1531, and having been received by the king,
attended by his lords and his bishops, he handed in a
letter from the Elector of Saxony, the Landgrave of
Hesse, and their allies. Francis opened it and appeared
to read it with interest. 'Sire,' wrote the
princes, 'a few monks (Tetzel and his friends) having
through avarice hawked their indulgences about
the country to the dishonour of Christ and the ruin
of souls,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_191" id="Ref_191" href="#Foot_191">[191]</a></span>
certain just and wise men have reproved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
them; the sun has risen upon the Church, and has
brought to light a world of scandals and errors.
Help us, Sire, and use such means that these disputes
may be settled, not by force of arms, but by a
lawful judgment, which shall do no violence to the
consciences of christians.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_192" id="Ref_192" href="#Foot_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>While Francis was reading this letter, the lords and
prelates of his court eyed the Lutheran from head
to foot. They went up to him and asked the strangest
questions. 'Is it true,' said a bishop, 'that the women
in your country have several husbands?'—'All nonsense!'
replied the German envoy. To other questions
he returned similar answers; the eagerness of the
speakers increased, and the conversation was becoming
animated, when the king, who had finished the letter,
declared that he thought it very reasonable, and, to
the great surprise of the court, smiled graciously upon
Reinhold.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_193" id="Ref_193" href="#Foot_193">[193]</a></span>
A few days later (21st April) he gave
the envoy an answer: 'In order to heal the sores of
the christian republic,' he said, 'there must be a council;
provided the Holy Ghost, who is the lord of truth,
has the chief place in it.' Then he added: 'Do not
fear the calumnies of your enemies.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_194" id="Ref_194" href="#Foot_194">[194]</a></span>
The first step was taken.</p>

<p>The grand idea of the counsellors of Francis I., and
of the king himself, was, at this time, to substitute for
the old policy of France a new and more independent
policy, which would protect it against the encroachments
of the papacy. Melanchthon was charmed at
the king's letter. 'The Frenchman answered us in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
the most amiable manner,' he said.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_195" id="Ref_195" href="#Foot_195">[195]</a></span>
A council guided
by the Spirit of God was precisely what the German
protestants demanded: they thought themselves on
the point of coming to an understanding with the
King of France. This hope took possession of Margaret
also, and of the powerful party in the royal
council who thought, like her, that the union of France,
Germany, and England would lead to an internal and
universal reform of christendom. The king, urged to
form an alliance with the German princes, resolved to
send an ambassador on his part, and selected for this
mission one Gervais Waim. The choice was an unlucky
one: Waim, a German by birth, but long resident
in Paris,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_196" id="Ref_196" href="#Foot_196">[196]</a></span>
desired that everything in Germany should
remain as he had left it. A blind partisan of the
ancient state of things, he regarded any change as an
outrage towards the German nation, and was full of
prejudices against the Reformation. Accordingly, he
had hardly arrived at Wittemberg (this was in the
spring of 1531), when he sought every opportunity
of gratifying his blind hatred. He met with a grand
reception; banquets and entertainments were given
in his honour. One day there was a large party, at
which Luther was present with his friends and many
evangelical christians, who were desirous of meeting
the envoy of the King of France. The latter, instead
of conciliating their minds, grew warm, and exclaimed:
'You have neither church nor magistrate nor marriage;
every man does what he pleases, and all is confusion
as among the brutes. The king my master knows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
it very well.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_197" id="Ref_197" href="#Foot_197">[197]</a></span>
On hearing this extravagant assertion,
the company opened their eyes. Some got
angry, others laughed, many despaired of ever coming
to an understanding with Francis I. Melanchthon
changed his opinion entirely. 'This man,' he said,
'is a great enemy of our cause.... The kings of the
earth think of nothing but their own interest; and if
Christ does not provide for the safety of the Church,
all is lost.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_198" id="Ref_198" href="#Foot_198">[198]</a></span>
He never said a truer thing. Waim
soon found that he had not been a good diplomatist,
and that he ought not to have shocked the protestant
sentiment; he therefore confined himself to his duty,
and his official communications were of more value
than his private conversations.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_199" id="Ref_199" href="#Foot_199">[199]</a></span>
 We shall see presently
the important steps taken by France towards
an alliance with evangelical Germany.</p>

<p class="side">=IMPRUDENCE OF THE FRENCH DEPUTY.=</p>

<p>Margaret, believing that the triumph of the good
cause was not far off, determined to move forward
a little. She had struck out of her prayer-book all
the prayers addressed to the Virgin and to the saints.
This she laid before the king's confessor, William Petit,
Bishop of Senlis, a courtier, and far from evangelical,
though abounding in complaisance for the sister of his
master. 'Look here!' she said; 'I have cut out all
the most superstitious portions of this book.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_200" id="Ref_200" href="#Foot_200">[200]</a></span>
—'Admirable!'
exclaimed the courtier; 'I should desire
no other.' The queen took the prelate at his word:
'Translate it into French,' she said, 'and I will have
it printed with your name.' The courtier-bishop did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
not dare withdraw; he translated the book, the queen
approved of it, and it appeared under the title of
<i>Heures de la Royne Marguerite</i> ('Queen Margaret's
Prayer-book'). The Faculty of Divinity was angry
about it, but they restrained themselves, not so much
because it was the queen's prayer-book, as because the
translator was a bishop and his Majesty's confessor.</p>

<p class="side">=LECOQ'S SERMON BEFORE THE KING.=</p>

<p>Nor did the Queen of Navarre stop here. There
was at that time in Paris a curé, named Lecoq, whose
preaching drew great crowds to St. Eustache. Certain
ladies of the court, who affected piety, never missed
one of his sermons. 'What eloquence!' said they,
speaking of Lecoq, one day when there was a reception
at St. Germain; 'what a striking voice! what a
flow of words! what boldness of thought! what fervent
piety!'—'Your fine orator,' said the king, who
was listening to them, 'is no doubt a Lutheran in disguise!'—'Not
at all, Sire,' said one of the ladies; 'he
often declaims against Luther, and says that we must
not separate from the Church.' Margaret asked her
brother to judge for himself. 'I will go,' said Francis.
The curé was informed that on the following Sunday
the king and all his court would come to hear his
sermon. The priest was charmed at the information.
He was a man of talent, and had received evangelical
impressions; only they were not deep, and the breath
of favour might easily turn him from the right way.
As this breath was just now blowing in the direction
of the Gospel, he entered with all his heart into this
conspiracy of the ladies, and began to prepare a discourse
adapted, as he thought, to introduce the new
light into the king's mind.</p>

<p>When Sunday came, all the carriages of the court
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
drew up before the church of St. Eustache, which the
king entered, followed by Du Bellay, Bishop of Paris,
and his attendant lords and ladies. The crowd was
immense. The preacher went up into the pulpit,
and everybody prepared to listen. At first the
king observed nothing remarkable; but gradually the
sermon grew warmer, and words full of life were
heard. 'The end of all visible things,' said Lecoq,
'is to lead us to invisible things. The bread which
refreshes our body tells us that Jesus Christ is the
life of our soul. Seated at the right hand of God,
Jesus lives by his Holy Spirit in the hearts of his
disciples. <i>Quæ sursum sunt quærite</i>, says St. Paul,
<i>ubi Christus est in dextera Dei sedens</i>. Yes, <i>seek those
things which are above</i>! Do not confine yourselves
during mass to what is upon the altar; raise yourselves
by faith to heaven, there to find the Son of God.
After he has consecrated the elements, does not the
priest cry out to the people: <i>Sursum corda!</i> lift up
your hearts! These words signify: Here is the bread
and here is the wine, but Jesus is in heaven. For this
reason, Sire,' continued Lecoq, boldly turning to the
king, 'if you wish to have Jesus Christ, do not look
for him in the visible elements; soar to heaven on the
wings of faith. <i>It is by believing in Jesus Christ that
we eat his flesh</i>, says St. Augustin. If it were true
that Christ must be touched with the hands and
devoured by the teeth,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_201" id="Ref_201" href="#Foot_201">[201]</a></span>
we should not say <i>sursum</i>,
upwards! but <i>deorsum</i>, downwards! Sire, it is to
heaven that I invite you. Hear the voice of the Lord:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
<i>sursum corda</i>, Sire, <i>sursum corda!</i>'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_202" id="Ref_202" href="#Foot_202">[202]</a></span>
And the sonorous
voice of the priest filled the whole church with
these words, which he repeated with a tone of the
sincerest conviction. All the congregation was moved,
and even Francis admired the eloquence of the preacher.
'What do you think of it?' he asked Du Bellay as they
were leaving the church.—'He may be right,' answered
the Bishop of Paris, who was not opposed to a moderate
reform, and who was married.—'I have a great mind
to see this priest again,' said the king.—'Nothing can
be easier,' replied Du Bellay.</p>

<p class="side">=FALL OF LECOQ.=</p>

<p>Precautions, however, were taken that this interview
should be concealed from everybody. The curé
disguised himself and was introduced secretly into
the king's private cabinet.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_203" id="Ref_203" href="#Foot_203">[203]</a></span>
'Leave us to ourselves,'
said Francis to the bishop.—'Monsieur le curé,' continued
he, 'have the goodness to explain what you
said about the sacrament of the altar.' Lecoq showed
that a spiritual union with Christ could alone be of use
to the soul. 'Indeed!' said Francis; 'you raise strange
scruples in my mind.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_204" id="Ref_204" href="#Foot_204">[204]</a></span>
This encouraged the priest,
who, charmed with his success, brought forward other
articles of faith.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_205" id="Ref_205" href="#Foot_205">[205]</a></span>
His zeal spoilt everything; it was
too much for the king, who began to think that the
priest might be a heretic after all, and ordered him to
be examined by a Romish doctor. 'He is an arch-heretic,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
said the inquisitor, after the examination.
'With your Majesty's permission I will keep him
locked up.' The king, who did not mean to go so
far, ordered Lecoq 'to be set at liberty, and to be
admitted to prove his assertions by the testimony of
Holy Scripture.'</p>

<p>Upon this the Cardinals of Lorraine and Tournon,
'awakened by the crowing of the cock,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_206" id="Ref_206" href="#Foot_206">[206]</a></span>
arranged a
conference. On one side was the suspected priest, on
the other some of the most learned doctors, and the
two cardinals presided as arbiters of the discussion.
Tournon was one of the ablest men of this period,
and a most implacable enemy of the Reformation; in
later years he was the persecutor of the Waldenses,
and the introducer of the Jesuits into France. The
discussion began. 'Whoever thought,' said the doctors
of the Sorbonne to Lecoq, 'that these words
<i>sursum corda</i> mean that the bread remains bread?
No; they signify that your heart should soar to
heaven in order that the Lord may descend upon the
altar.' Lecoq showed that the Spirit alone gives life;
he spoke of Scripture; but Tournon, who had been the
means of making more than one pope, and had himself
received votes for his own election to the papacy,
exclaimed in a style that the popes are fond of using:
'The Church has spoken; submit to her decrees. If
you reject the authority of the Church, you sail without
a compass, driven by the winds to your destruction.
Delay not!... Save yourself! Down with the yards
and furl the sails, lest your vessel strike upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
rocks of error, and you suffer an eternal shipwreck.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_207" id="Ref_207" href="#Foot_207">[207]</a></span>
The cardinals and doctors surrounded Lecoq and
pressed him on every side. Here a theologian fell
upon him with his elaborate scholastic proofs; there
an abbé shouted in his ears; and the cardinals threw
the weight of their dignity into the scales. The curé
of St. Eustache was tossed to and fro in indecision.
He had some small taste for the Gospel, but he loved
the world and its honours more. They frightened
and soothed him by turns, and at last he retracted
what he had preached. Lecoq had none of the qualities
of a martyr: he was rather one of those weak
minds who furnished backsliders to the primitive
Church.</p>

<p>Happily there were in France firmer christians than
he. While, in the world of politics, diplomatists were
crossing and recrossing the Rhine; while, in the world
of Roman-catholicism, the most eloquent men were
becoming faithless to their convictions: there were
christian men in the evangelical world, among those
whose faith had laid hold of redemption, who sacrificed
their lives that they might remain faithful to the
Lord who had redeemed them. It was a season when
the most contrary movements were going on.</p>

<p>Toulouse, in olden times the sanctuary of Gallic
paganism, was at this period filled with images, relics,
and 'other instruments of Romish idolatry.' The
religion of the people was a religion of the eye and
of the ear, of the hands and of the knees—in short, a
religion of externals; while within, the conscience,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
the will, and the understanding slept a deep sleep.
The parliament, surnamed 'the bloody,' was the docile
instrument of the fanaticism of the priests. They
said to their officers: 'Keep an eye upon the heretics.
If any man does not lift his cap before an image, he is
a heretic. If any man, when he hears the <i>Ave Maria</i>
bell, does not bend the knee, he is a heretic. If any
man takes pleasure in the ancient languages and polite
learning, he is a heretic.... Do not delay to inform
against such persons.... The parliament will condemn
them, and the stake shall rid us of them.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_208" id="Ref_208" href="#Foot_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>A celebrated Italian had left his country and settled
at Agen. Julius Cesar della Scala, better known by
the name of Scaliger, belonged to one of the oldest
families of his native country, and on account of the
universality of his knowledge, many persons considered
him the greatest man that had ever appeared
in the world. Scaliger did not embrace the reformed
faith, as his son did, but he imported a love of learning,
particularly of Greek, to the banks of the Garonne.</p>

<p class="side">=CATURCE AT TOULOUSE.=</p>

<p>The licentiate Jean de Caturce, a professor of laws
in the university, and a native of Limoux, having
learnt Greek, procured a New Testament and studied
it. Being a man of large understanding, of facile
eloquence, and above all of thoughtful soul, he found
Christ the Saviour, Christ the Lord, Christ the life
eternal, and adored him. Erelong Christ transformed
him, and he became a new man. Then the Pandects
lost their charm, and he discovered in the Holy Scriptures
a divine life and light which enraptured him.
He meditated on them day and night. He was consumed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
by an ardent desire to visit his birthplace and
preach the Saviour whom he loved and who dwelt in
his heart. Accordingly he set out for Limoux, which
is not far from Toulouse, and on All Saints' day, 1531,
delivered 'an exhortation' there. He resolved to return
at the Epiphany, for every year on that day
there was a great concourse of people for the festival,
and he wished to take advantage of it by openly
proclaiming Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="side">=THE TWELFTH-NIGHT SUPPER.=</p>

<p>Everything had been prepared for the festival.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_209" id="Ref_209" href="#Foot_209">[209]</a></span>
On the eve of Epiphany there was usually a grand
supper, at which, according to custom, the king of
the feast was proclaimed, after which there was shouting
and joking, singing and dancing. Caturce was
determined to take part in the festival, but in such a
way that it should not pass off in the usual manner.
When the services of the day in honour of the three
kings of the East were over, the company sat down
to table: they drank the wine of the south, and at last
the cake was brought in. One of the guests found
the bean, the gaiety increased, and they were about
to celebrate the new royalty by the ordinary toast:
<i>the king drinks!</i> when Caturce stood up. 'There is
only one king,' he said, 'and Jesus Christ is he. It
is not enough for his name to flit through our brains—he
must dwell in our hearts. He who has Christ in
him wants for nothing. Instead then of shouting <i>the
king drinks</i>, let us say this night: <i>May Christ, the
true king, reign in all our hearts!</i>'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_210" id="Ref_210" href="#Foot_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>The professor of Toulouse was much esteemed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
his native town, and many of his acquaintances already
loved the Gospel. The lips that were ready to shout
<i>the king drinks</i> were dumb, and many sympathised,
at least by their silence, with the new 'toast' which
he proposed to them. Caturce continued: 'My
friends, I propose that after supper, instead of loose
talk, dances, and revelry, each of us shall bring forward
in his turn one passage of Holy Scripture.'
The proposal was accepted, and the noisy supper was
changed into an orderly christian assembly. First
one man repeated some passage that had struck him,
then another did the same; but Caturce, says the
chronicle, 'entered deeper into the matter than the
rest of the company,' contending that Jesus Christ
ought to sit on the throne of our hearts. The professor
returned to the university.</p>

<p>This Twelfth-night supper produced so great a
sensation, that a report was made of it at Toulouse.
The officers of justice apprehended the licentiate in
the midst of his books and his lessons, and brought
him before the court. 'Your worships,' he said, 'I
am willing to maintain what I have at heart, but let
my opponents be learned men with their books, who
will prove what they advance. I should wish each
point to be decided without wandering talk.' The
discussion began; but the most learned theologians
were opposed to him in vain, for the licentiate, who
had the Divine Word within him, answered 'promptly,
pertinently, and with much power, quoting immediately
the passages of Scripture which best served
his purpose,' says the chronicle. The doctors were
silenced, and the professor was taken back to prison.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_211" id="Ref_211" href="#Foot_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></div>

<p>The judges were greatly embarrassed. One of
them visited the <i>heretic</i> in his dungeon, to see if he
could not be shaken. 'Master Caturce,' said he, 'we
offer to set you at full liberty, on condition that
you will first retract only three points, in a lecture
which you will give in the schools.' The chronicler
does not tell us what these three points were. The
licentiate's friends entreated him to consent, and for
a moment he hesitated, only to regain his firmness
immediately after. 'It is a snare of the Evil one,'
he replied. Notwithstanding this, his friends laid
a form of recantation before him, and when he had
rejected it, they brought him another still more skilfully
drawn up. But 'the Lord strengthened him so
that he thrust all these papers away from him.' His
friends withdrew in dismay. He was declared a
heretic, condemned to be burnt alive, and taken to
the square of St. Etienne.</p>

<p>Here an immense crowd had assembled, especially
of students of the university who were anxious to witness
the degradation of so esteemed a professor. The
'mystery' lasted three hours, and they were three
hours of triumph for the Word of God. Never had
Caturce spoken with greater freedom. In answer to
everything that was said, he brought some passage of
Scripture 'very pertinent to reprove the stupidity of
his judges before the scholars.' His academical robes
were taken off, the costume of a merry-andrew was
put on him, and then another scene began.</p>

<p class="side">=THE DOMINICAN SILENCED.=</p>

<p>A Dominican monk, wearing a white robe and
scapulary, with a black cloak and pointed cap, made
his way through the crowd, and ascended a little
wooden pulpit which had been set up in the middle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
of the square. This by no means learned individual
assumed an important air, for he had been commissioned
to deliver what was called 'the sermon
of the catholic faith.' In a voice that was heard all
over the square, he read his text: <i>The Spirit speaketh
expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart
from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and
doctrines of devils</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_212" id="Ref_212" href="#Foot_212">[212]</a></span>
The monks were delighted with
a text which appeared so suitable; but Caturce, who
almost knew his Testament by heart, perceiving that,
according to their custom of distorting Scripture, he
had only taken a fragment (<i>lopin</i>) of the passage,
cried out with a clear voice: 'Read on.' The Dominican,
who felt alarmed, stopped short, upon which
Caturce himself completed the passage: <i>Forbidding
to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats,
which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving
of them which believe</i>. The monks were confounded;
the students and other friends of the
licentiate smiled. 'We know them,' continued the
energetic professor, 'these deceivers of the people,
who, instead of the doctrine of faith, feed them with
trash. In God's service there is no question of fish
or of flesh, of black or of grey, of Wednesday or Friday....
It is nothing but foolish superstition which
requires celibacy and abstaining from meats. Such
are not the commandments of God.' The Dominican
in his pulpit listened with astonishment; the prisoner
was preaching in the midst of the officers of justice,
and the students heard him 'with great favour.' The
poor Dominican, ashamed of his folly, left his sermon
unpreached.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></div>

<p>After this the martyr was led back to the court,
where sentence of death was pronounced upon him.
Caturce surveyed his judges with indignation, and, as
he left the tribunal, exclaimed in Latin: 'Thou seat
of iniquity! Thou court of injustice!' He was now
led to the scaffold, and at the stake continued exhorting
the people to know Jesus Christ. 'It is impossible
to calculate the great fruit wrought by his death,'
says the chronicle, 'especially among the students
then at the university of Toulouse,' that is to say, in
the year 1532.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_213" id="Ref_213" href="#Foot_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Certain preachers, however, who had taught the
new doctrine, backslided deplorably at this time, and
checked the progress of the Word in the south; among
them were the prothonotary of Armagnac, the cordelier
Des Noces, as well as his companion the youthful
Melchior Flavin, 'a furious hypocrite,' as Beza calls
him. One of those who had received in their hearts
the fire that warmed the energetic Caturce, held firm
to the truth, even in the presence of the stake: he
was a grey friar named Marcii. Having performed
'wonders' by his preaching in Rouergue, he was
taken to Toulouse, and there sealed with his blood the
doctrines he had so faithfully proclaimed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_214" id="Ref_214" href="#Foot_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=TWO MODES OF REFORMATION.=</p>

<p>We must soon turn to that external reformation
imagined by some of the king's advisers, under the
inspiration of the Queen of Navarre, and by certain
German protestants who, under the influence of
motives partly religious, partly political, proposed to
reform Christendom by means of a council, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
doing away with the Romish episcopate. But we
must first return to that humble and powerful teacher,
the noble representative of a scriptural and living
reformation, who, while urging the necessity of a
spiritual unity, set in the foremost rank the imprescriptible
rights of truth.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XX.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">CALVIN'S SEPARATION FROM THE HIERARCHY:
                             HIS FIRST WORK, HIS FRIENDS.<br />
 (1532.)</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">LECOQ had been caught in the snares of the world;
Caturce had perished in the flames; some elect
souls appeared to be falling into a third danger—a sort
of christianity, partly mystical, partly worldly, partly
Romanist. But there was a young man among the
evangelicals who was beginning to occasion some uneasiness
in the lukewarm. Calvin—for it is of him
we speak—was successively attacked on these three
sides, and yet he remained firm. He did more than
this, for every day he enlarged the circle of his
christian activity. An advocate, a young <i>frondeur</i>, a
pious tradesman, a catholic student, a professor of the
university, and the Queen of Navarre—all received
from him at this time certain impulses which carried
them forward in the path of truth.</p>

<p class="side">=DANIEL'S VIEWS FOR CALVIN.=</p>

<p>The advocate Daniel loved him dearly, and desired
to keep him in the Romish communion. His large
understanding, his energetic character, his indefatigable
activity seemed to promise the Church a St.
Augustin or a St. Bernard; he must be raised to
some important post where he would have a prospect
of making himself useful. The advocate, who thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
Calvin far less advanced in the ways of liberty than
he really was, had an idea of obtaining for him an
ecclesiastical charge which, he imagined, would perfectly
suit his young friend: it was that of official or
vicar-general, empowered to exercise episcopal jurisdiction.
Would Daniel succeed? Would he rob the
Reformation of this young and brilliant genius?
Influential men were ready to aid him in establishing
Calvin in the ranks of the Romish hierarchy.
Accordingly the first temptation to which he was
exposed proceeded from clerical ambition.</p>

<p>An ecclesiastic of high birth, John, Count of
Longueville and Archbishop of Toulouse, had been
appointed Bishop of Orleans in 1521, with permission
to retain his archbishopric.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_215" id="Ref_215" href="#Foot_215">[215]</a></span>
In 1532 a new bishop
was expected at Orleans, either because Longueville
was dead, or because, on account of his illness, a coadjutor
had become necessary. The pluralist prelate
was a fellow-countryman of Calvin's.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_216" id="Ref_216" href="#Foot_216">[216]</a></span>
Daniel, thinking
that he ought to seize this opportunity of procuring
the post of official for the young scholar,
made the first overtures to Calvin on the 6th of
January, 1532. 'I never will abandon,' he said, 'the
old and mutual friendship that unites us.' And
then, having by this means sought to conciliate his
favourable attention, he skilfully insinuated his wishes.
'We are expecting the bishop's arrival every day; I
should be pleased if, by the care of your friends, you
were so recommended to him that he conferred on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
you the charge of official or some other post.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_217" id="Ref_217" href="#Foot_217">[217]</a></span>
There
was much in this to flatter the self-love of a young
man of twenty-three. If Calvin had been made vicar-general
at so early an age, he would not have stopped
there; that office often led to the highest dignities, and
his brilliant genius, his great and strong character,
would have made him a bishop, cardinal, who can say?
... perhaps pope. Instead of freeing the Church he
would have enslaved it; and instead of being plain
John Calvin he might perhaps have been the Hildebrand
of his age.</p>

<p>What will Calvin do? Although settled as regards
doctrine, he was still undecided with regard to the
Church: it was a period of transition with him. 'On
the one hand,' he said, 'I feel the call of God which
holds me fast to the Church, and on the other I fear
to take upon myself a burden which I cannot bear....
What perplexity!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_218" id="Ref_218" href="#Foot_218">[218]</a></span>
Erelong the temptation presented
itself. 'Consider!' whispered an insidious
voice; 'an easy, studious, honoured, useful life!'—'Alas!'
he said, 'as soon as anything appears which
pleases us, instantly the desires of the flesh rush impetuously
after it, like wild beasts.' We cannot tell
whether these 'wild beasts' were roused in his ardent
soul, but at least, if there was any covetousness
within, 'which tempted the heart,' he forced it to
be still. Strong decision distinguishes the christian
character of Calvin. The new man within him rejected
with horror all that the old man had loved.
Far from entering into new ties, he was thinking of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
breaking those which still bound him to the Roman
hierarchy. He therefore did not entertain Daniel's
proposal. Of the two roads that lay before him, he
chose the rougher one, and gave himself to God
alone.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S COMMENTARY ON SENECA.=</p>

<p>Having turned his back on bishops and cardinals,
Calvin looked with love upon the martyrs and their
burning piles. The death of the pious Berquin and
of other confessors had distressed him, and he feared
lest he should see other believers sinking under the
same violence. He would have desired to speak in
behalf of the dumb and innocent victims. 'But, alas!'
he exclaimed, 'how can a man so mean, so low-born,
so poor in learning as I, expect to be heard?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_219" id="Ref_219" href="#Foot_219">[219]</a></span>
He had finished his commentary upon Seneca's treatise of
<i>Clemency</i>. Being a great admirer of that philosopher,
he was annoyed that the world had not given him the
place he deserved, and spoke of him to all his friends.
If one of them entered his little room and expressed
surprise at seeing him take such pains to make the
writings of a pagan philosopher better known, Calvin,
who thought he had discovered a vein of Gospel gold
in Seneca's iron ore, would answer: 'Did he not write
against superstition? Has he not said of the Jews,
that the conquered give laws to their conquerors?
When he exclaims: "We have all sinned, we shall all
sin unto the end!"<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_220" id="Ref_220" href="#Foot_220">[220]</a></span>
may we not imagine that we hear
Paul speaking?'</p>

<p>Another motive, however, as some think, influenced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
Calvin to select the treatise on <i>Clemency</i>. There was
a similarity (and Calvin had noticed it) between the
epochs of the author and of the commentator. Seneca,
who lived at the time of the first persecutions against
the christians, had dedicated his treatise on <i>Clemency</i>
to a persecutor. Calvin determined to publish it with
a commentary, in the hope (it has been said) that the
king, who was fond of books, would read this legacy
of antiquity. Without absolutely rejecting this hypothesis,
we may say that he was anxious to compose
some literary work, and that he displayed solid learning
set off by an elegant and pleasing style which
at once gave him rank among the literati of his day.</p>

<p>These are the words of Seneca, which, thanks to
Calvin, were now heard in the capital of the kings of
France: 'Clemency becomes no one so much as it does
a king.—You spare yourself, when you seem to be
sparing another. We must do evil to nobody, not
even to the wicked; men do not harm their own diseased
limbs. It is the nature of the most cowardly
wild beasts to rend those who are lying on the ground,
but elephants and lions pass by the man they have
thrown down.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_221" id="Ref_221" href="#Foot_221">[221]</a></span>
To take delight in the rattling of
chains, to cut off the heads of citizens, to spill much
blood, to spread terror wherever he shows himself—is
that the work of a king? If it were so, far better
would it be for lions, bears, or even serpents to reign
over us!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_222" id="Ref_222" href="#Foot_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE YOUNG AUTHOR'S DIFFICULTIES.=</p>

<p>As soon as the work was finished, Calvin thought
of publishing it; but the booksellers turned their backs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
on him, for an author's first work rarely tempts them.
The young commentator was not rich, but he came to
a bold resolution. He felt, as it would appear, that
authorship would be his vocation, that God himself
called him, and he was determined to take the first
step in spite of all obstacles. He said: 'I will publish
the book on <i>Clemency</i> at my own expense;' but when
the printing was finished, he became uneasy. 'Upon
my word,' he said, 'it has cost me more money than
I had imagined.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_223" id="Ref_223" href="#Foot_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>The young author wrote his name in Latin on the
title-page of the first work he published, <i>Calvinus</i>,
whence the word <i>Calvin</i> was derived, which was substituted
for the family name of <i>Cauvin</i>. He dedicated
his book to the abbot of St. Eloy (4th April, 1532),
and then gave it to the world. It was a great affair
for him, and he was full of anxiety at its chances and
dangers. 'At length the die is cast,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_224" id="Ref_224" href="#Foot_224">[224]</a></span>
he wrote to
Daniel on the 23rd of May; 'my Commentary on
<i>Clemency</i> has appeared.'</p>

<p>Two thoughts engrossed him wholly at this time:
the first concerned the good that his book might do.
'Write to me as soon as possible,' said he to his friend,
'and tell me whether my book is favourably or coldly
received.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_225" id="Ref_225" href="#Foot_225">[225]</a></span>
I hope that it will contribute to the public
good.' But he was also very anxious about the sale:
all his money was gone. 'I am drained dry,' he said;
'and I must tax my wits to get back from every quarter
the money I have expended.'</p>

<p>Calvin showed great activity in the publication of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
his first work; we can already trace in him the captain
drawing out his plan of battle. He called upon several
professors in the capital, and begged them to use his
book in their public lectures. He sent five copies to
his friends at Bourges, and asked Sucquey to deliver
a course of lectures on his publication. He made
the same request to Landrin with regard to the university
of Orleans.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_226" id="Ref_226" href="#Foot_226">[226]</a></span>
In short, he lost no opportunity
of making his book known.</p>

<p>Daniel had asked him for some Bibles. Probably
Calvin's refusal to accept office in the Church had not
surprised the advocate, and this pious man desired
to circulate the book which had inspired his young
friend with such courage and self-denial. But it was
not easy to execute the commission. There was Lefèvre's
Bible, printed in French at Antwerp in 1530;
and the Latin Bible of Robert Stephens, which appeared
at Paris in 1532. The latter was so eagerly
bought up, that the doctors of the Sorbonne tried to
prohibit the sale. It was probably this edition which
Calvin tried to procure. He went from shop to shop,
but the booksellers looked at him with suspicion, and
said they had not the volume. Calvin renewed his inquiries
in the Latin quarter, where at last he found
what he sought at a bookseller's who was more independent
of the Sorbonne and its proclamations
than the others. 'I have executed your commission
about the Bible,' he wrote to Daniel; 'and it cost me
more trouble than money.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_227" id="Ref_227" href="#Foot_227">[227]</a></span>
Calvin profited by the
opportunity to entreat his friend to deliver a course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
of lectures on the <i>Clemency</i>. 'If you make up your
mind to do so,' he wrote, 'I will send you a hundred
copies.' These copies were, no doubt, to be sold to
Daniel's hearers. Such were the anxieties of the great
writer of the sixteenth century at the beginning of his
career. Calvin's first work (it deserves to be noted)
was on <i>Clemency</i>. Did the king read the treatise?...
We cannot say; at any rate, Calvin was not more fortunate
with Francis I. than Seneca had been with Nero.</p>

<p class="side">=AN UNHAPPY FRONDEUR.=</p>

<p>Another case of a very different nature occupied
his attention erelong. Calvin had a great horror of
falsehood: calumny aroused his anger, whether it
was manifested by gross accusations, or insinuated by
equivocal compliments. Among his friends at the
university there was a young man whom he called
his excellent brother, whose name has not been preserved.
All his fellow-students loved him; all the
professors esteemed him;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_228" id="Ref_228" href="#Foot_228">[228]</a></span>
but occasionally he showed
himself a little rough. This unknown student, having
received the good news of the Gospel with all his
soul, felt impelled to speak about it out of the abundance
of his heart, and rebelled at the obligation he
was under of concealing his convictions. There was
still in him some remnant of the 'old man,' and feeling
indignant at the weakness of those around him,
and being of a carping temper, he called them
cowards. He could not breathe in the atmosphere
of despotism and servility in which he lived. He
loved France, but he loved liberty more. One day this
proud young man said to his friends: 'I cannot bend
my neck beneath the yoke to which you so willingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
submit.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_229" id="Ref_229" href="#Foot_229">[229]</a></span>
Farewell! I am going to Strasburg, and
renounce all intention of returning to France.'</p>

<p>Strasburg did not satisfy him. The eminent men
who resided there sometimes, and no doubt with good
intentions, placed peace above truth. The caustic
opinions of the young Frenchman displeased Bucer
and his friends. He was a grumbler by nature, and
spoke out bluntly on all occasions.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_230" id="Ref_230" href="#Foot_230">[230]</a></span>
He had a sharp
encounter with a Strasburger, whose name Calvin
does not give, and who was perhaps just as susceptible
as the Parisian was hasty. The young Frenchman
was declaiming against baptismal regeneration, when
on a sudden his adversary, whom Calvin judges with
great moderation, began to accuse the poor refugee
of being an anabaptist. This was a dreadful reproach
at that time. Wherever he went the Strasburger
scattered his accusations and invectives. Every
heart was shut against the poor fellow; he was not
even permitted to make the least explanation. He
was soon brought to want, and claimed the assistance
of friends whom he had formerly helped. It
was all of no use. Reduced to extreme necessity,
having neither the means of procuring food nor of
travelling, he managed however to return to France
in a state of the greatest destitution. He found Calvin
at Noyon, where the latter chanced to be at the
beginning of September 1532.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN RECEIVES HIM KINDLY.=</p>

<p>The young man, soured and disappointed, drew a
sad picture of Strasburg. 'There was not a single
person in the whole city from whom I could obtain a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
penny,' he said. 'My enemy left not a stone unturned;
scattering the sparks of his wrath on every
side, he kindled a great fire.... My sojourn there was
a real tragedy, which had the ruin of an innocent
man for its catastrophe.' Calvin questioned him on
baptism, and the severe examination was entirely to
the advantage of the young refugee. 'Really,' said
the commentator on <i>Clemency</i>, 'I have never met
with any one who professed the truth on this point
with so much frankness.' Calvin did not lose a moment,
but sat down (4th of September) to write to
Bucer, whom he styled the <i>bishop</i> of Strasburg.
'Alas!' he said, 'how much stronger calumny is
than truth! They have ruined this man's reputation,
perhaps without intention, but certainly without
reason. If my prayers, if my tears have any value
in your eyes, dear Master Bucer, have pity on the
wretchedness of this unfortunate man!<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_231" id="Ref_231" href="#Foot_231">[231]</a></span>
You are
the protector of the poor, the help of the orphan;
do not suffer this unhappy man to be reduced to the
last extremity.'</p>

<p>Shortly after writing this touching appeal, Calvin
returned to Paris. As for the young man, we know
not what became of him. He was not, however, the
only one who first attacked and then called for pity.</p>

<p>The literary movement of the capital manifested
itself more and more every day in a biblical direction.
Guidacerio of Venice, devoting himself to scriptural
studies, published a commentary on the <i>Song of Solomon</i>,
and an explanation of the <i>Sermon on the Mount</i>,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_232" id="Ref_232" href="#Foot_232">[232]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
to the great annoyance of the doctors of the Sorbonne,
who were angry at seeing laymen break through their
monopoly of interpreting Scripture. Priests in their
sermons, students in their essays, put forward propositions
contrary to the Romish doctrine; and Beda,
who was beside himself, filled Paris with his furious
declamations. He soon met with a cutting reply.
Some young friends of learning gave a public representation
of a burlesque comedy entitled: 'The university
of Paris is founded on a monster.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_233" id="Ref_233" href="#Foot_233">[233]</a></span>
Beda
could not contain himself: 'They mean me,' he
exclaimed, and called together the Faculties. They
laid the matter before the inquisitors of the faith, who
had the good sense to let it drop.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_234" id="Ref_234" href="#Foot_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE MERCHANT DE LA FORGE.=</p>

<p>When Calvin returned to Paris, he did not join this
literary world, which was jeering at the attacks of
the priests: he preferred the narrow and the thorny
way. Every day he attended the meetings which
were held secretly in different parts of the capital. He
associated with pious families, sat at the hearths of the
friends of the Gospel, and discoursed with them on the
truth and on the difficulties which the Reformation
would have to encounter in France. A pious and
open-hearted merchant, a native of Tournay, Stephen
de la Forge by name, particularly attracted him at this
time. When he entered his friend's warehouse, he
was often struck by the number of purchasers and by
the bustle around him. 'I am thankful,' said La
Forge, 'for all the blessings that God has given me;
and I will not be sparing of my wealth, either to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
succour the poor or to propagate the Gospel.' In
fact, the merchant printed the Holy Scriptures at his
own expense, and distributed copies along with the
numerous alms he was in the habit of giving. Noble,
kind-hearted, ready to share all that he possessed with
the poor, he had also a mind capable of discerning
error. He was good, but he was not weak. Certain
doctors, infidel and immoral philosophers, were beginning
at that time to appear in Paris, and to visit at
La Forge's, where Calvin met them. The latter asked
his friend who these strange-looking people were:
'They pretend to have been banished from their country,'
said La Forge; 'perhaps.... But if so, believe
me it was for their misdeeds and not for the Word of
God.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_235" id="Ref_235" href="#Foot_235">[235]</a></span>
They were the chiefs of the sectarians afterwards
known by the name of <i>Libertines</i>, who had just
come from Flanders. La Forge not only gave his
money, but was able somewhat later to give himself,
and to die confessing Jesus Christ. When Calvin
remembered at Geneva the sweet conversations they
had enjoyed together, he exclaimed with a sentiment
of respect: 'O holy martyr of Jesus Christ! thy
memory will always be sacred among believers.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_236" id="Ref_236" href="#Foot_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides La Forge, Calvin had another intimate
friend at Paris, whose personal character possessed a
great attraction for him, although the tendency of his
mind was quite different from that of his own. Louis
du Tillet was one of those gentle moderate christians,
who fear the cross and are paralysed by the opinion of
the world. The <i>frondeur</i> and he were two extremes:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
Calvin was a mean between them. Du Tillet wished to
maintain the Catholic Church, even when reforming
it, for he respected its unity. The reformer had been
struck with his charity, his humility, and his love of
truth; while Louis, on the other hand, admiring 'the
great gifts and graces which the Lord had bestowed on
his friend,' was never tired of listening to him. He
belonged to a noble family of Angoulême; his father
was vice-president of the Chamber of Accounts; his
eldest brother was the king's valet-de-chambre; and
his other brother was second chief-registrar to the
parliament. He was continually fluctuating between
Calvin and his own relatives, between Scripture and
tradition, between God and the world. He would
often leave Calvin to go and hear mass; but erelong,
attracted by a charm for which he could not account,
he returned to his friend, whose clear ideas threw some
little light into his mind. Du Tillet exclaimed: 'Yes,
I feel that there is much ignorance and darkness
within me.' But the idea of forsaking the Church
alarmed him, and he had hardly uttered such words
as these when he hurried off again to confess.</p>

<p>Calvin, thanks to the numerous friends who saw him
closely, began to be appreciated even by those who
calumniated his faith. 'This man at least leads an
austere life,' they said: 'he is not a slave to his belly;
from his youth he has abhorred the pleasures of the
flesh;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_237" id="Ref_237" href="#Foot_237">[237]</a></span>
he indulges neither in eating nor drinking.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_238" id="Ref_238" href="#Foot_238">[238]</a></span>
... Look at him ... his mind is vigorous; his soul
unites wisdom with daring.... But his body is thin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
and spare; one clearly sees that his days and nights
are devoted to abstinence and study.'—'Do not suppose
that I fast on account of your superstitions,' said
Calvin. 'No! it is only because abstinence keeps
away the pains that disturb me in my task.'</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN AND COP.=</p>

<p>Professor Nicholas Cop, son of that William Cop,
the king's physician, the honour of whose birth (says
Erasmus) both France and Germany disputed,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_239" id="Ref_239" href="#Foot_239">[239]</a></span>
had
recognised an inward life in Calvin, and a vigorous
faith which captivated him, and he never met him in
the neighbourhood of the university without speaking
to him. They were often seen walking up and down
absorbed in talk, while the priests looked on distrustfully.
These conversations disturbed them: 'Cop
will be spoilt,' they said, and they endeavoured to
prejudice him against his friend; but their intimacy
only became stricter.</p>

<p>Calvin's reputation, which was beginning to extend,
reached the ears of the Queen of Navarre, and that
princess, who admired men of genius and delighted
in agreeable conversation, wished to see the young
literary christian. Thus there was an early intercourse
between them. The christian and learned
scholar undertook the defence of the sister of Francis I.
in a letter written to Daniel in 1533, and this princess
afterwards made known to him the projected
marriage of her daughter Jeanne d'Albret—circumstances
which indicate an intimate connection between
them. During the time when the piety of the Queen
of Navarre was the purest, a mutual respect and
affection united these two noble characters. 'I conjure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
you,' said Margaret to Calvin, 'do not spare me
in anything wherein you think I can be of service to
you. Rest assured that I shall act with my whole
heart, according to the power that God has given
me.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_240" id="Ref_240" href="#Foot_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=MARGARET AND CALVIN.=</p>

<p>'A man cannot enter the ministry of God,' says
Calvin, 'without having been proved by temptation.'
The queen's wit, the court of St. Germain, intercourse
with men of genius and of rank, the prospect of exercising
an influence that might turn to the glory of God—all
these things might tempt him. Would he become
Margaret's chaplain, like Roussel? Would he quit
the narrow way in which he was treading, to enter
upon that where christians tried to walk with the
world on their right hand and Rome on their left?
The queen's love for the Saviour affected Calvin, and
he asked himself whether that was not a door opened
by God through which the Gospel would enter the
kingdom of France.... He was at that moment on the
brink of the abyss. What likelihood was there that
a young man, just at the beginning of his career,
would not gladly seize the opportunity that presented
itself of serving a princess so full of piety and genius—the
king's sister? Margaret, who made Roussel a
bishop, would also have a diocese for Calvin. 'I should
be pleased to have a servant like you,' she told him
one day. But the rather mystical piety of the princess,
and the vanities with which she was surrounded, were
offensive to that simple and upright heart. 'Madame,'
he replied, 'I am not fitted to do you any great service;
the capacity is wanting, and also you have enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
without me.... Those who know me are aware that I
never desired to frequent the courts of princes; and I
thank the Lord that I have never been tempted, for I
have every reason to be satisfied with the good Master
who has accepted me and retains me in his household.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_241" id="Ref_241" href="#Foot_241">[241]</a></span>
Calvin had no more longing for the semi-catholic
dignities of the queen than for the Roman dignities of
the popes. Yet he knew how to take advantage of
the opportunity offered him, and nobly conjured Margaret
to speak out more frankly in favour of the Gospel.
Carried away by an eloquence which, though simple,
had great power, she declared herself ready to move
forward.</p>

<p>An opportunity soon presented itself of realising
the plan she had conceived of renewing the universal
Church without destroying its unity; but the means
to be employed were not such as Calvin approved
of. They were about to have recourse to carnal
weapons. 'Now the only foundation of the kingdom
of Christ,' he said, 'is the humiliation of man. I know
how proud carnal minds are of their vain shows;
but the arms of the Lord, with which we fight, will
be stronger, and will throw down all their strongholds,
by means of which they think themselves invincible.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_242" id="Ref_242" href="#Foot_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>Luther now appears again on the scene; and on this
important point Luther and Calvin are one.</p>

 (<span class="smc">March to October 1532.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="side">=DU BELLAY'S PROJECTS.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">FRANCE, or at least the king and the influential men,
appeared at this time to be veering towards a moderate
Reform. Francis I. seemed to have some liking
for his sister's religion; but there were other motives
inclining him to entertain these ideas. Finding himself
without allies in Europe, he endeavoured to gain the
friendship of the protestants, hoping that with their
help he would be in a condition to oppose the emperor
and restore the French preponderance in Italy. One
man in particular set himself the task of directing his
country into a new path; this was William du Bellay,
brother to the Bishop of Paris, and 'one of the greatest
men France ever had,' says a catholic historian.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_243" id="Ref_243" href="#Foot_243">[243]</a></span>
A skilful, active, and prudent diplomatist, Du Bellay
called to mind the memorable struggles that had formerly
taken place between the popes and the kings of
France; he believed that christendom was in a state of
transition, and desired, as the Chancellor de l'Hôpital
did in later years, that the new times should be marked
with more liberty, and not with more servitude, as the
Guises, the Valois, and the Bourbons would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
wished. He went even farther: he thought that the
sixteenth century would substitute for the papacy of
the middle ages a form of christianity, catholic of
course, but more in conformity with the ancient Scriptures
and the modern requirements. From that hour
his dominant idea, his chief business, was to unite
catholic France to protestant Germany.</p>

<p>Having received the instructions of Francis I., Du
Bellay left Honfleur, where the king was staying,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_244" id="Ref_244" href="#Foot_244">[244]</a></span>
on the 11th of March, 1532, and crossed the Rhine about
the middle of April. At Schweinfurth-on-the-Maine,
between Wurtzburg and Bamberg, he found an assembly
composed of a few protestant princes on one side,
and a few mediators on the other, among whom was
the elector-archbishop of Mayence. As this brings us
into Germany, it is necessary that we should take a
glance at what had happened there since the great
diet of Augsburg in 1530.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_245" id="Ref_245" href="#Foot_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>The catholics and protestants had made up their
minds at that time for a contest, and everything foreboded
the bursting of the storm in the next spring
(1531). There were, so to say, two contrary currents
among the friends of the Reformation in Germany.
One party (the men of prudence) wished
that the evangelical states should seek powerful alliances
and prepare to resist the emperor by force of
arms; the other (the men of piety) called to mind
that the Reformation had triumphed at Augsburg by
faith, and added that from faith all its future triumphs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
were to be expected. These two parties had frequent
meetings at Wittemberg, Torgau, and elsewhere.
One man especially, with open countenance and firm
look, whose lips seemed always ready to speak, made
his clear and sonorous voice heard: this was Luther.
'To God alone,' he told the elector, 'belongs the
government of the future; your Highness must therefore
persevere in that faith and confidence in God
which you have just displayed so gloriously at Augsburg.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_246" id="Ref_246" href="#Foot_246">[246]</a></span>
But the jurists of Torgau were not entirely
of that opinion, and they endeavoured to prove that
their rights in the empire authorised the protestants to
repel force by force. Luther was not to be shaken. 'If
war breaks out,' he replied, 'I call God and the world
to witness, that the Lutherans have in no wise provoked
it; that they have never drawn the sword,
never thrown men into prison, never burnt, killed,
and pillaged, as their adversaries have done; and, in
a word, that they have never sought anything but
peace and quietness.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_247" id="Ref_247" href="#Foot_247">[247]</a></span>
The politicians smiled at such
enthusiasm, and said that in real life things must go
on very differently. A conference was appointed for
the consideration of what was to be done, and in the
meanwhile great efforts were made to win over new
allies to the protestant cause.</p>

<p class="side">=ALLIANCE OF SMALCALD.=</p>

<p>On the 29th of March, 1531, the deputies of the
protestant states met at Smalcald, in the electorate
of Hesse. In the eyes of the peace party this was a
place of evil omen: the town was fortified, and there
were iron mines in the neighbourhood, from which arms
have been manufactured and cannons founded. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
the deputies proceeded to the castle of Wilhelmsburg,
built on a hill near the town, they wore a mournful
anxious look. They were disappointed in the hope
they had entertained of seeing Denmark, Switzerland,
Mecklenburg, and Pomerania join them. Nevertheless
they did not hesitate, notwithstanding their
weakness, to assert their rights against the power of
Charles V. Nine princes and eleven cities entered
into an alliance for six years 'to resist all who should
try to constrain them to forsake the Word of God and
the truth of Christ.'</p>

<p>This resolution was received with very different
sentiments. Some said that it was an encroachment
on the spirituality of the Church; others maintained
that since liberty of conscience was a civil as well as
a religious right, it ought to be upheld, if necessary,
by force of arms. They soon went farther. Some
persons proposed, with a view of making the alliance
closer, to introduce into all the evangelical churches
a perfect uniformity both of worship and ecclesiastical
constitution; but energetic voices exclaimed that this
would be an infringement of religious liberty under
the pretence of upholding it. When the deputies
met again at Frankfort, on the 4th of June, these generous
men said boldly: 'We will maintain diversity
for fear that uniformity should, sooner or later, lead
to a kind of popery.' They understood that the inward
unity of faith is better than the superficial unity
of form.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_248" id="Ref_248" href="#Foot_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>After various negotiations the evangelicals met at
Schweinfurth to receive the proposals of their adversaries;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
and it was during this conference (April and
May 1532) that the ambassador of the King of France
arrived. When the protestants saw him appear, they
were rather embarrassed; but still they received
him with respect. He soon found out in what a
critical position the men of the confession of Augsburg
were placed. True, the mediators offered them
peace, but it was on condition that they made no
stipulations in favour of those who might embrace
the Gospel hereafter. This proposal greatly irritated
the Landgrave of Hesse, his chancellor Feig, and
the other members of the conference. 'What!' exclaimed
the Hessians, 'shall a barrier be raised between
protestantism and popery, and no one be allowed
to pass it?... No! the treaty of peace must equally
protect those who now adhere to the confession of
Augsburg and those who may hereafter do so.'—'It
is an affair of conscience,' wrote the evangelical theologians,
and Urban Regius in particular; 'this is a
point to be given up on no account.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_249" id="Ref_249" href="#Foot_249">[249]</a></span>
The electoral
prince himself was resolved to adopt this line of
conduct.</p>

<p class="side">=LUTHER OPPOSES DIPLOMACY AND WAR.=</p>

<p>Luther was not at Schweinfurth, but he kept on
the look-out for news. He spoke about the meeting
to his friends; he attacked the schemes of the politicians;
all these negotiations, stipulations, conventions,
signatures, ratifications, and treaties in behalf
of the Gospel annoyed him. When he learnt what
they were going to do at Schweinfurth, he was dismayed.
To presume to save the faith with protocols
was almost blasphemous in his eyes! One of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
powerful letters fell like a bomb-shell into the midst
of the conference. 'When we were without any support,'
he said, 'and entirely new in the empire, with
struggles and combats all around us, the Gospel
triumphed and truth was upheld, despite the enemies
who wished to stifle them both. Why should
not the Gospel triumph now with its own strength?
Why should it be necessary to help it with our diplomacy
and our treaties? Is not God as mighty now
as then? Does the Almighty want us to vote the aid
that we mean to give him in future by our human
stipulations?'...</p>

<p>These words of Luther caused general consternation.
People said to one another that 'the Doctor had
been ill, and that he had consoled his friends by saying:
"Do not be afraid; if I were to sink now, the
papists would be too happy; therefore I shall not die."
They added that his advice against treaties was no doubt
a remnant of his fever; the great man is not quite right
in his mind; the prince-electoral and the excellent chancellor
Bruck wrote to the elector, who was in Saxony,
that everybody was against Luther, who appeared to
have no understanding of business.' But the reformer
did not suffer himself to be checked; on the contrary,
he begged the elector to write a sharp letter to his representatives.
'The princes and burgesses have embraced
the Gospel at their own risk and peril,' he
said, 'and in like manner every one must in future
receive and profess it at his own expense.' At the
same time he began to agitate Wittemberg, and drew
up an opinion which Pomeranus signed with him. In
it he said: 'I will never take upon my conscience
to provoke the shedding of blood, even to maintain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
our articles of faith. It would be the best means of
destroying the true doctrine, in the midst of the confusions
of war.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_250" id="Ref_250" href="#Foot_250">[250]</a></span>
The reformer thought that if the
Lutherans and the Zwinglians, the Germans and the
Swiss united, they would feel so strong, that they
would assume the initiative and draw the sword—which
he wished to avert by all means in his power.</p>

<p class="side">=DU BELLAY'S OVERTURES.=</p>

<p>But the politicians were not more inclined to give
way than the theologians. On the contrary, they
made preparations for receiving the ambassador of
France, in which, however, there was some difficulty.
The diplomatist's arrival compromised them with the
imperialists; they could not receive him in the assembly
at Schweinfurth, since catholic princes would be
present. The protestants therefore went a few miles
off, to the little town of Königsberg in Franconia,
between Coburg, Bamberg, and Schweinfurth. Here
they formed themselves into a secret committee and
received the ambassador. 'Most honoured lords,'
said Du Bellay, 'the king my master begs you will
excuse him for not having sent me to you sooner.
That proceeds neither from negligence nor from want
of affection, but because he desired to come to some
understanding with the King of England, who also
wishes to help you in your great enterprise. The
negotiations are not yet ended; but my august master,
desirous of avoiding longer delay, has commissioned me
to say that you will find him ready to assist you. Yes,
though he should do it alone; though his brother of
England (which he does not believe) were to refuse;
though the emperor should march his armies against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
you, the king will not abandon you. On the honour
of a prince, he said. I have received ample powers to
arrange with you about the share of the war expenses
which his Majesty is ready to pay.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_251" id="Ref_251" href="#Foot_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The circumstances were not favourable for the proposals
of Francis I. The pacific ideas of Luther prevailed.
The Elector of Saxony, who was then ill,
desired to die in peace. He therefore sided with the
reformer, and it was agreed to name in the act of
alliance the princes and cities that had already adhered
to the confession of Augsburg, and that they alone
should be included in the league. These peaceful
ideas of the protestants did not harmonise with the
warlike ideas of King Francis. Du Bellay was not
discouraged, and skilfully went upon another tack;
while the Saxon diplomatists were compelled to yield
to the will of their master, Du Bellay remarked a
young prince, full of spirit and daring, who spared
nobody and said aloud what he thought. This was
the Landgrave of Hesse, who complained unceasingly
either of Luther's advice, or of the resolution of the
conference. 'The future will show,' he told everybody,
'whether they have acted wisely in this matter.'
The minister of Francis I., who was of the landgrave's
opinion, entered into communication with him.</p>

<p>An important question—the question of Wurtemberg—at
that time occupied Germany. In 1512
Duke Ulrich, annoyed because he had not more influence
in the Suabian league, had seceded from it,
quarrelled with the emperor, thrown that prince's
adherents into prison, burdened his subjects with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
oppressive taxes, and caused trouble in his own family.
In consequence of all this, the emperor expelled
him from his states in 1519 and 1520, and he took
refuge in his principality of Montbéliard. It seemed
that adversity had not been profitless to him. In
1524, when Farel went to preach the Reformation at
Montbéliard, Ulrich (as we have seen<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_252" id="Ref_252" href="#Foot_252">[252]</a></span>
) defended religious
liberty. When the emperor was at Augsburg
in 1530, wishing to aggrandise the power of Austria,
he had given the duchy of Wurtemberg to his brother
Ferdinand, to the great indignation of the protestants,
and especially of the landgrave. 'We must
restore the legitimate sovereign in Wurtemberg,' said
this young and energetic prince: 'that will take the
duchy from the catholic party and give it to the protestants.'
But all the negotiations undertaken with
this view had failed. If, however, one of the great
powers of Europe should take up the cause of the
dukes of Wurtemberg, their restoration would be
easier. Francis I. had not failed to see that he could
checkmate the emperor here. 'As for the Duke of
Wurtemberg,' said Du Bellay to the Königsberg conference,
'the king my lord will heartily undertake to
serve him to the utmost of his power, without infringing
the treaties.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_253" id="Ref_253" href="#Foot_253">[253]</a></span>
The landgrave had taken
note of these words, and their result was to establish
the Reformation in a country which is distinguished
by its fervent protestantism and its zeal in propagating
the Gospel to the ends of the world.</p>

<p class="side">=PEACE OF NUREMBERG.=</p>

<p>A mixed assembly of catholics and protestants
having met at Nuremberg in the month of May, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
protestants demanded a council in which everything
should be decided 'according to the pure Word of
God.' The members of the Romish party looked
discontented: 'It is a captious, prejudiced, and anti-catholic
condition,' they said. Yet, as the Turks
were threatening the empire, it was necessary to
make some concessions to the Reformation, in order
to be in a condition to resist them. The violent
fanatics represented to no purpose that Luther was
not much better than Mahomet; peace was concluded
at Nuremberg on the 23rd of July, 1532, and it was
agreed that, while waiting for the next free and general
council, the <i>status quo</i> should be preserved, and
all Germans should exercise a sincere and christian
friendship. This first religious peace cheered with
its mild beams the last days of the elector John of
Saxony. On the 14th of August, 1532, that venerable
prince, whom even the imperialists styled 'the
Father of the German land,' was struck with apoplexy.
'God help me!' he exclaimed, and immediately expired.
'Wisdom died with the elector Frederick,'
said Luther, 'and piety with the elector John.'</p>

<p>Yet Du Bellay was always harassed by the desire
of emancipating from Rome that France which the
Medici, the Guises, the Valois, and afterwards the
Bourbons, were about to surrender to her. He therefore
increased his exertions among the protestants to
induce them to accept the friendship, if not the alliance,
of his master. But they had no great confidence in
'the Frenchman;' they were afraid that they would be
surprised, deceived, and then abandoned by Francis;
they 'shook with fear.' The ambassador was more
urgent than ever; he accepted the conditions of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
protestants, and the two parties signed a sort of agreement.
Du Bellay returned to Francis I., who was then
in Brittany, and the king having heard him, sent him
instantly to England, to give Henry VIII. a full
account of all his negotiations with the protestant
princes.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_254" id="Ref_254" href="#Foot_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus politicians were intriguing on every side. In
Germany, France, and England, the princes imagined
that they could conquer by means of diplomacy; but
far different were the forces by which the victory was
to be gained. In the midst of all this activity of courts
and cabinets, there was an inner and secret activity
which stirred the human mind and excited in it a
burning thirst, which the truth and the life of God
alone could quench. Centuries before, as early as
1020, the revival had begun in Aquitaine, at Orleans,
and on the Rhine. Men had proclaimed that christians
'ought to be filled with the Holy Ghost; that
God would be with them, and would give them the
treasures of his wisdom.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_255" id="Ref_255" href="#Foot_255">[255]</a></span>
This inward movement had
gone on growing from age to age. The Waldenses in the
twelfth century, the purest portion of the Albigenses in
the thirteenth, Wickliffe and the Lollards in the fourteenth,
and John Huss and his followers in the fifteenth,
are the heroes of this noble war. This christian life
arose, increased, and spread; if it was extinguished in
one country, it reappeared in another. The religious
movement of the mind gained strength; the electricity
was accumulated in the battery; the mine was charged,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
and the explosion was certain erelong. All this was
being accomplished under the guidance of a sovereign
commander. He applied the match in the sixteenth
century by the hand of Luther; once more he sprang
the mine by the powerful preaching of Calvin, Knox,
and others. It was this that won the victory, and not
diplomacy. However, we have not yet done with it.</p>

<p class="side">=MEETING OF FRANCIS AND HENRY.=</p>

<p>At this time Francis I. was enraptured with
Henry VIII., calling him his 'good brother' and
'perpetual ally.' Wearied of the pope and of the
popedom, which appeared as if unable to shake off the
tutelage of Charles V., the King of France saw Germany
separating from Rome, and England doing the
same, and Du Bellay was continually asking him why
he would not conclude a triple alliance with these two
powers? Such a coalition, formed in the name of the
revival of learning and of reform in the Church, would
certainly triumph over all the opposition made to it by
ignorance and superstition. Francis I. had not made
up his mind to break entirely with the pope, though
he was resolved to unite with the pope's enemies. In
order to conclude a close alliance with Henry, he chose
the moment when that prince was most out of humour
with the court of Rome. The articles were drawn up
on the 23rd of June, 1532.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_256" id="Ref_256" href="#Foot_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>The two kings were not content with making preparations
only for the great campaign they meditated
against the emperor and Rome: they determined to
have an interview. On the 11th of October, 1532,
the gallant Henry, accompanied by a brilliant court,
crossed the Channel and arrived at Calais, at that time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
an English possession; while the elegant Francis,
attended by his three sons and many of his nobles,
arrived at Boulogne one or two days later. The great
point with Francis was glory—a victory to be gained
over Charles V.; the great point with Henry was to
gratify his passions, and as Clement VII. thwarted him,
he had a special grudge against the pope. With such
hatreds and such intentions, it was easy for the two
kings to come to an understanding.</p>

<p>Their first meeting was at Boulogne, in the abbot's
palace, where they stayed four days under the same
roof. Francis was inexhaustible in attentions to his
guest; but the important part of their business was
transacted in one of their closets, where these impetuous
princes confided to each other their anger and
their plans. The King of England gave vent to 'great
complaints and grievances' against Clement VII. 'He
wants to force me to go to Rome in person. If
he means to institute an inquiry, let him send his
proctors to England. Let us summon the pope (he
added) to appear before a free council empowered to
inquire into the abuses under which princes and people
suffer so severely, and to reform them.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_257" id="Ref_257" href="#Foot_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Francis, who also had 'goodwill to complain,'
filled the abbot's palace with his grievances: 'I have
need of the clergy-tenths (the tenth part of the Church
revenues), in order that I may resist the Turk; but
the holy father opposes my levying them. I have
need of all the resources of my subjects; but the holy
father is continually inventing new exactions, which
transfer the money of my kingdom into the coffers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
the popedom. He makes us pay annates, maintain
pontifical officers at a great expense, and give large
presents to prothonotaries, valets, chamberlains, ushers,
and others. And what is the consequence? The
clergy are poor; the ruined churches are not repaired;
and the indigent lack food.... Most assuredly
the Roman government is only <i>a net to catch
money</i>. We must have a council.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_258" id="Ref_258" href="#Foot_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>The two princes resolved to 'take from the pope
the obedience of their kingdoms,' as Guicciardini says.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_259" id="Ref_259" href="#Foot_259">[259]</a></span>
However, before resorting to extreme measures, Francis
desired to begin with milder means, and Henry
was forced to consent that France should forward his
grievances to Rome.</p>

<p class="side">=THE MASKED LADY.=</p>

<p>After living together for four days at Boulogne,
Henry and Francis went to Calais, where the latter
found his apartments hung with cloth of gold, embroidered
with pearls and precious stones. At table,
the viands were served on one hundred and seventy
dishes of solid gold. Henry gave a grand masked
ball, at which the King of France was considerably
tantalised by a masked lady of very elegant manners
with whom he danced. She spoke French like a
Frenchwoman, abounded in wit and grace, and knew,
in its most trifling details, all the scandal of the
court of France. The king declared the lady to be
charming, and her neck the prettiest he had ever seen.
He little imagined then that this neck would one day
be severed by the orders of Henry VIII. At the
end of the dance, the King of England, with a smile,
removed the lady's mask, and showed the features of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
Anne Boleyn, Marchioness of Pembroke, who (it will
be recollected) had been brought up at the court of
the French king's sister.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_260" id="Ref_260" href="#Foot_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Pleasure did not make the two princes forget business.
They were again closeted, and signed a treaty,
in accordance with which they engaged to raise an
army of 65,000 infantry and 15,000 cavalry, intended
apparently to act against the Turks.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_261" id="Ref_261" href="#Foot_261">[261]</a></span>
Du Bellay's
policy was in the ascendant. 'The great king,' he
said, 'is staggering from his obedience.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_262" id="Ref_262" href="#Foot_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=FRANCIS THREATENS SEPARATION.=</p>

<p>Wishing to make a last effort before determining
to break with the pope, Francis summoned Cardinals
de Tournon and de Gramont, men devoted to his
person, and said to them: 'You will go to the holy
father and lay before him in confidence both our
grievances and our dissatisfaction. You will tell him
that we are determined to employ, as soon as may be
advisable, all our alliances, public as well as private,
to execute great things ... from which much damage
may ensue and perpetual regret for the future. You
will tell him that, in accord with other christian
princes, we shall assemble a council without him, and
that we shall forbid our subjects in future to send
money to Rome. You will add—but as a secret and
after taking the pope aside—that in case his holiness
should think of censuring me and forcing me to go
to Rome for absolution, I shall come, but <i>so well
attended</i> that his holiness will be only too eager to
grant it me....</p>

<p>'Let the pope consider well,' added the king, 'that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
the Germans, the Swiss League, and several other
countries in Christendom, have separated from Rome.
Let him understand that if two powerful kings like
us should also secede, we should find many imitators,
<i>both Italians and others</i>;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_263" id="Ref_263" href="#Foot_263">[263]</a></span>
 and that, at the least, there
would be a greater war in Europe than any known
in time past.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_264" id="Ref_264" href="#Foot_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Such were the proud words France sent to Rome.
The two kings separated. A young prince, held
captive by Charles V., gave them the first opportunity
of acting together against both emperor and
pope.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">A CAPTIVE PRINCE ESCAPES FROM THE HANDS OF THE EMPEROR.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Autumn 1532.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE news of the meeting of Francis I. and Henry VIII. alarmed Germany, Italy, and all Europe.
'The kings of France and England,' it was said, 'are
going to take advantage of the emperor's campaign
against the Turks, to unite their armies with those of
the protestants and gain a signal victory.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_265" id="Ref_265" href="#Foot_265">[265]</a></span>
But nobody
was more alarmed than the pope. Abruptly
addressing the Bishop of Auxerre, the minister of
France, he made the bitterest complaints to him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_266" id="Ref_266" href="#Foot_266">[266]</a></span>
Already he saw France, like England, shaking off the
yoke of Rome. 'I have it from good authority,'
says Brantôme, 'that the King of France was on the
point of renouncing the pope, as the King of England
had done.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_267" id="Ref_267" href="#Foot_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>On leaving Boulogne, Francis went to Paris, where
he spent the winter and took his measures for 'the
great effort' with which he threatened the pope. The
priests were very uneasy, and began to dread a reform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
similar to that in England. Calling to mind that in
Denmark, Sweden, and elsewhere, a great part of the
ecclesiastical property had been transferred to the
treasury of the State, they granted the king all he
asked; and the prince thus obtained between five
and six hundred thousand ducats, which put him in
a condition to do 'the great things' with which the
cardinals were to menace the pontiff.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_268" id="Ref_268" href="#Foot_268">[268]</a></span>
An unexpected
event furnished the opportunity of employing
the priests' money in favour of the Reformation.</p>

<p class="side">=CHARLES V. HASTENS TO ITALY.=</p>

<p>The haughty Soliman had invaded Hungary, in
July 1532, at the head of numerous and terrible
hordes. Displaying a luxury without precedent, he
gave audience on a golden throne, with a crown of
solid gold at his side, and the scabbards of his
swords covered with pearls. But erelong the sickly
Charles succeeded in terrifying this magnificent barbarian.
Having raised an army which combined the
order and strength of the German lansquenets with
the lightness and impetuosity of the Italian bands and
the pride and perseverance of the Spanish troops, he
forced Soliman to retreat. The emperor was all the
more delighted, as the conference between Henry and
Francis made him impatient to settle with the Mussulmans.
It was even said in the empire that it was this
conference which brought Charles back, as he desired
to join the pope in combating projects which threatened
them both. The emperor passed the Alps in the
autumn of 1532.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_269" id="Ref_269" href="#Foot_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
Among the nobles and warriors who accompanied
him, was a young prince of eighteen, Christopher,
son of Duke Ulrich of Wurtemberg. He was only
five years old when his father was expelled from his
duchy by the Austrians; and the latter, wishing to
make him forget Wurtemberg, resolved to separate
him from his country and his parents. The little boy
and his guardians having left Stuttgard, stopped to
pass the night in a town near the frontier. A lamb
was gambolling in the yard; the poor boy, delighted
with the gentleness of the animal, ran and took it up
in his arms, and began to play with it. In the morning,
just as they were leaving, little Christopher, less
distressed at their taking away his sceptre than at their
separating him from his pet companion, kissed it with
tears in his eyes, and said to the host: 'Pray take
care of it, and when I return I will pay you for your
trouble.'</p>

<p>Christopher was taken to Innsbruck, where his life
was a hard one. The young prince who, in later
times, filled his country with evangelical schools, had
no one to cultivate his mind, and he who was one day
to sit at the table of kings was often half-starved; his
dress was neglected, and even the beggars, when they
saw him, were moved with compassion. From Innsbruck
he was transferred to Neustadt (Nagy-Banya)
in Hungary, beyond the Theiss. One day a troop of
Turkish horsemen, having crossed the Carpathians,
scoured the country that lay between the mountains
and the river, and, catching sight of the prince,
rushed upon him to carry him off. But a faithful
follower, who had observed their movements, shouted
for help, and succeeded in saving Christopher from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
hands of the Mussulmans. And thus the heir of
Wurtemberg grew up in the bosom of adversity.</p>

<p class="side">=THE PRINCE AND HIS GOVERNOR.=</p>

<p>The noble-hearted man who had saved him at the
peril of his own life was Michael Tifernus. In his
early childhood he had been carried off by the Turks,
and, being abandoned by them, he had succeeded in
reaching a village near Trieste, where some kind people
took care of him. Tifernus (who derived this name
from the place of his adoption, for his parents' name
was never known) was sent to a school in Vienna, where
he received a sound education. King Ferdinand, who
was guilty of negligence towards Christopher rather
than of ill-will, gave him Tifernus for tutor. The
latter attached himself passionately to the prince, who,
under his care, became an accomplished young man.
In the midst of the splendours of the court of Austria
and of the Roman worship, grew up one who was erelong
to rescue Wurtemberg from both Austria and
Rome. An important circumstance occurred to agitate
the young prince deeply, and throw a bright light over
his dark path.</p>

<p>Christopher accompanied the emperor in 1530 to the
famous diet of Augsburg. He was struck by the noble
sight of the fidelity and courage of the protestants.
He heard them make their confession of faith; his
elevated soul took the side of the oppressed Gospel;
and when, at this very diet, Charles solemnly invested
his brother Ferdinand with the duchy of Wurtemberg,—when
Christopher saw the standard of his fathers
and of his people in the hands of the Austrian archduke—the
feeling of his rights came over him; he
viewed the triumphant establishment of the evangelical
faith in the country of his ancestors as a task
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
appointed him. He would recover his inheritance,
and, uniting with the noble confessors of Augsburg,
would bring an unexpected support to the Reformation.</p>

<p>The emperor, after the war against the Turks, desired
the prince to accompany him to Italy and Spain;
perhaps it was his intention to leave him there; but
Christopher made no objection. He had arranged his
plans: two great ideas, the independence of Wurtemberg
and the triumph of the Reformation, had taken
possession of his mind, and while following the emperor
and appearing to turn his back on the states of his
fathers, he said significantly to his devoted friend
Tifernus: 'I shall not abandon my rights in Germany.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_270" id="Ref_270" href="#Foot_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=PRINCE CHRISTOPHER'S ESCAPE.=</p>

<p>Charles V. and his court were crossing the Alps in
the autumn of 1532. The young duke on horseback
was slowly climbing the passes which separate Austria
from Styria, contemplating the everlasting snows
in the distance, and stopping from time to time on
the heights from whose base rushed the foaming torrents
which descend from the sides of the mountains.
He had a thoughtful look, as of one absorbed by
some great resolution. The news of the interview
of Francis I. and Henry VIII., which had alarmed
Austria, had inflamed his hopes; and he said to himself
that now was the time for claiming his states.
He had conversed with his governor about it, and it
now remained to carry the daring enterprise into
execution. To escape from Charles V., surrounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
by his court and his guards, seemed impossible; but
Christopher believing that God can <i>deliver out of the
mouth of the lion</i>, prayed him to be his guide during
the rest of his life. As etiquette was not strictly
observed in these mountains, Christopher and his
governor lagged a little in the rear of their travelling
companions. A tree, a rock, a turn in the road
sufficed to hide them from view. Yet, if one of the
emperor's attendants should turn round too soon and
look for the laggards, the two friends would be ruined.
But no one thought of doing so: erelong they were at
some distance from the court, and could see the imperial
procession stretching in the distance, like a
riband, along the flanks of the Norican Alps. On a
sudden the two loiterers turned their horses, and set
off at full gallop. They asked some mountaineers to
show them a road which would take them to Salzburg,
and continued their flight in the direction indicated.
But there were some terrible passes to cross; Christopher's
horse broke down, and it was impossible to
proceed. What was to be done? Perhaps the imperialists
were already on their track.</p>

<p>The two friends were not at a loss. There was a
lake close at hand; they dragged the useless animal
by the legs towards it, and buried it at the bottom of
the water, in order that there might be no trace of
their passage. 'Now, my lord,' said his governor,
'take my horse and proceed; I shall manage to get
out of the scrape.' The young duke disappeared,
and not before it was time. 'What has become of
Prince Christopher?' asked Charles's attendants. 'He
is in the rear,' was the reply; 'he will soon catch us
up.' As he did not appear, some of the imperial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
officers rode back in search of him. The little
lake into which the prince's horse had been thrown
was partly filled with tall reeds, among which
Tifernus lay concealed. Presently the imperialists
passed close by him; he heard their steps, their voices;
they went backwards and forwards, but found nothing.
At last, they returned and mournfully reported the
uselessness of their search. It was believed that
the two young men had been murdered by brigands
among the mountains. The court continued its
progress towards Italy and Rome. All this time
Christopher was fleeing on his governor's horse, and
by exercising great prudence he reached a secure
asylum without being recognised, and here he kept
himself in concealment under the protection of his
near relatives the dukes of Bavaria. Tifernus joined
him in his retreat.</p>

<p class="side">=CHRISTOPHER CLAIMS HIS STATES.=</p>

<p>The report of Christopher's death was circulated
everywhere; the Austrians, who had no doubt about
it, felt surer than ever of Wurtemberg; they were
even beginning to forget the prince, when a document
bearing his name and dated the 17th of November,
1532,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_271" id="Ref_271" href="#Foot_271">[271]</a></span>
was suddenly circulated all over Germany.
Faithful to his resolution, the young prince in this
noble manifesto gave utterance to the bitterest complaints,
and boldly claimed his inheritance in the face
of the world. This paper, which alarmed Ferdinand
of Austria, caused immense joy in Wurtemberg and
all protestant Germany. The young prince had everything
in his favour: an age which always charms, a
courage universally acknowledged, virtues, talents,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
graceful manners, an ancient family, a respected name,
indisputable rights, and the love of his subjects.
They had not seen him, indeed, since the day when
he had bedewed the pet lamb with his tears; but
they hailed him as their national prince who would
recover their independence. Protected by the Duke
of Bavaria, by the Landgrave of Hesse, and by the
powerful King of France, Christopher had all the
chances in his favour. He had more: he had the
support of God. As a friend of the Gospel, he
would give fresh strength to the great cause of the
Reformation. Du Bellay would use all his zeal to
reestablish him on the throne, and thus procure an
ally for France who would help her to enter on the
path of religious liberty.</p>

<p>We must now return to the country of Margaret
of Navarre, and see how this princess began to realise
her great project of having the pure Gospel preached
in the bosom and under the forms of the Roman
Catholic Church.</p>

                             THE METROPOLITAN CHURCHES.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Lent 1533.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE alliance with England, and the hope of being
able, sooner or later, to triumph over Charles V.,
filled the King of France with joy; and accordingly
the carnival of the year 1533 was kept magnificently
at Paris. The court was absorbed in entertainments,
balls, and banquets. The young lords and ladies
thought of nothing but dancing and intriguing, at
which soberer minds were scandalised. 'It is quite
a Bacchanalia,' said the evangelicals.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_272" id="Ref_272" href="#Foot_272">[272]</a></span>
As soon as
the carnival was ended, Francis started for Picardy;
leaving the King and Queen of Navarre at Paris.
Margaret now breathed more freely. She had been
compelled, willingly or unwillingly, to take part in
all the court fêtes; and she now determined to make
up for it by organising a great evangelical preaching
instead of the 'bacchanalia' at which she had
sometimes been present. Was not Francis holding
out his hand to the King of England and to the protestants
of Germany? The opportunity should be
seized of preaching the new doctrine boldly. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
Queen of Navarre sent for Roussel and communicated
her intention to him. She will open the great
churches of the capital, and from their pulpits the
inhabitants of Paris shall hear the mighty summons.
The poor almoner, in whom courage was not the
most prominent virtue, was alarmed at first. In the
handsome saloons of Margaret he might indulge in his
pious and rather mystical aspirations; but to enter
the pulpits of Paris ... the very thought dismayed
him, and he begged the queen to find some other
person. Roussel did not deny that it was right to
preach the Gospel publicly, but declared himself to
be incompetent for the work. 'The minister of the
Gospel,' he said, 'ought to possess an invincible faith.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_273" id="Ref_273" href="#Foot_273">[273]</a></span>
The enemy against which he fights is the kingdom of
hell with all its powers.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_274" id="Ref_274" href="#Foot_274">[274]</a></span>
... He must defend himself
on the right hand and on the left.... What do you
require of me? To preach peace, but under the cross!
To bring in the kingdom of God, but among the strongholds
of the devil.... To speak of repose in the midst
of the most furious tempests, of life in the midst of
death, of blessedness in the midst of hell! Who is
fitted for such things?... Doubtless it is a noble
task, but no one ought to undertake it unless he
is called to it. Now I feel nothing in me which a

<p class="side">=ROUSSEL'S HESITATION.=</p>

<p>Such a man as Calvin would certainly have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
preferable, but Margaret would neither have dared
nor wished to put him in the front. These sermons
undoubtedly formed part of the chaplain's duty;
and hence the Queen, an energetic and impulsive
woman, being determined to profit by the opportunity
of giving the Gospel free entrance into Paris, persisted
with Roussel, promised him the help of her prayers
and of her favour, and at last prevailed on him to
preach. In truth, his modesty is an honour to
him: no doubt there was boldness wanted; but
many humble and candid souls would have hesitated
like him. He was fitter than he imagined for
the work which the Queen of Navarre had taken in
hand.</p>

<p>This obstacle having been surmounted, Margaret
met with another. It was the custom for the Sorbonne
to appoint the preachers, and it was impossible
to get them to accept Roussel. 'They will nominate
some furious and insolent monks,' says Calvin, 'who
will make the churches ring with their insults
against truth.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_276" id="Ref_276" href="#Foot_276">[276]</a></span>
The struggle began, and despite
the absence of Francis, despite the influence of the
Queen of Navarre, the Sorbonne gained the day, and
the pulpits of the capital were closed against the
almoner. Margaret was very indignant at these
doctors, who looked upon themselves as the doorkeepers
of the kingdom of heaven, and by their
tyranny prevented the door from being opened; but
Roussel was by no means sorry to be prohibited from
a work beyond his strength.</p>

<p class="side">=PREACHINGS AT THE LOUVRE.=</p>

<p>But nothing could stop the queen. Being resolved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
to give the Gospel to France, she said to herself that it
must be done now or never. Her zeal carried her to
an extraordinary act. The Sorbonne closed the doors
of the churches against Roussel: Margaret opened to
him the palace of the king. She had a saloon prepared
in the Louvre, and gave orders to admit all who desired
to enter. Was the king informed of this? It is
possible, and even probable, that he was. He did not
fear to show the pope and Charles V. how far his alliance
with Henry VIII. and the protestants would extend.
He would not have liked to appear schismatic
and heretical; but he sometimes was pleased that his
sister should do so; and he could always vindicate
himself on the ground of absence.</p>

<p>A Lutheran sermon at the Louvre! That was truly
a strange thing; and accordingly the crowd was so
great that there was not room for them. Margaret
threw open a larger hall, but that too was filled, as
well as the corridors and ante-chamber.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_277" id="Ref_277" href="#Foot_277">[277]</a></span>
A third time
the place of meeting was changed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_278" id="Ref_278" href="#Foot_278">[278]</a></span>
She had vainly
selected the largest hall; the galleries and adjoining
rooms were filled, and room was wanting still. These
evangelical preachings at the Louvre excited a lively
curiosity in Paris. They were all the fashion, and the
worthy Roussel, to his great surprise, became quite
famous. He preached every day during Lent,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_279" id="Ref_279" href="#Foot_279">[279]</a></span>
and every day the crowd grew larger. Nobles, lawyers,
men of letters, merchants, scholars, and tradespeople
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
of every class flocked to the Louvre from all parts of
Paris, especially from the quarters of the University
and St. Germain. At the hour of preaching, the citizens
poured over the bridges in a stream, or crossed
the Seine in boats. Some were attracted by piety,
some by curiosity, and others by vanity. Four or five
thousand hearers crowded daily round Roussel.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_280" id="Ref_280" href="#Foot_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>When the worthy citizens, students, and professors
had climbed the stairs at the Louvre, crossed the antechambers,
and reached the door of the principal saloon,
they stopped, opened their eyes wide, and looked
wonderingly on the sight presented to them in the
monarch's palace. The King and Queen of Navarre
were in the chief places, seated in costly chairs, whence
the active Margaret cast a satisfied glance on all those
courtiers, those notables of the city, those curious
Parisians, those friends of Reform, who were flocking
to hear the Word of God. There were people of
every rank: John Sturm, already so decided for the
Gospel, was seen by the side of the elegant John de
Montluc, afterwards Bishop of Valence. At length
the minister appeared; he prayed with unction, read
the Scriptures with gravity, and then began his exhortations
to the hearers. His language was simple,
but it stirred their hearts profoundly. Roussel proclaimed
the salvation obtained by a living faith, and
urged the necessity of belonging to the invisible
Church of the saints. Instead of attacking the Roman
religion, he addressed his appeals to the conscience;
and this preaching of the Gospel (rather softened down
as it was) won, instead of irritating, men's minds.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
Accustomed as they were to the babbling of the monks,
the congregation listened seriously to the practical
preaching of the minister of God. Here were no
scholastic subtleties, no absurd legends, no amusing
anecdotes, no burlesque declamations, and no unclean
pictures: it was the Gospel.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_281" id="Ref_281" href="#Foot_281">[281]</a></span>
As they quitted the
Louvre, men conversed about the sermon or the
preacher. Sturm of Strasburg and John de Montluc,
in particular, often talked together.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_282" id="Ref_282" href="#Foot_282">[282]</a></span>
The satisfaction
was general. 'What a preacher!' they said; 'we have
never heard anything like it! What freedom in his
language! what firmness in his teaching!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_283" id="Ref_283" href="#Foot_283">[283]</a></span>
Some of
his hearers wrote in their admiration to Melanchthon,
who informed Luther, Spalatin, and others of it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_284" id="Ref_284" href="#Foot_284">[284]</a></span>
Germany rejoiced to see France begin to move at last.</p>

<p>Margaret, who had a lively imagination and warm
heart, was all on fire. She spoke to the worldlings
of that 'peace of God which passeth all understanding.'
She said to the friends of the Gospel:
'The Almighty will graciously complete what he has
graciously begun through us.' She added: 'I will
spend myself in it.' She excited and stirred up
everybody about her, and the crowded congregations
of the Louvre were in great measure the result of her
incessant activity. She knew how by a word or a message
to attract courtiers whose only thoughts were of
debauchery, and catholics whose only wish was for the
pope. Like a sabbath-bell, she called Paris to hear the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
voice of God, and drew the crowd. Possessing in the
highest degree, so long as her brother did not check it,
that energy which women often show in religious
matters, she was resolved to prosecute her work and
win the prize of the contest.</p>

<p>She returned to her first idea. She said to herself
that the best way to effect a reform in the Church
without occasioning a schism, was for the Gospel to
be preached in the churches of Paris and of France.
The ceremonies of the Roman worship and the jurisdiction
of the bishops would remain, but Christ would
be proclaimed. This system, which was fundamentally
that of Melanchthon and even of Luther at this time,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_285" id="Ref_285" href="#Foot_285">[285]</a></span>
she did her best to realise. The victory she had just
achieved at the Louvre doubled her courage; she determined
to have the churches which had been refused
to her at first. She therefore began to work upon the
king, and, as he was thinking only of his alliances with
Henry VIII. and the protestants, she obtained from
him an order authorising the Bishop of Paris to appoint
whom he pleased to preach in his diocese.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_286" id="Ref_286" href="#Foot_286">[286]</a></span>
The prelate,
who was a brother of the diplomatist Du Bellay,
passed like him for a friend of the Reformation. At
Margaret's request he named two evangelical Augustine
monks—Courault and Berthaud. 'Strange!'
said the public voice; 'here are men of the order to
which Luther belonged going to preach the doctrine
of the great reformer in the capital of France.' All the
evangelicals were overjoyed and wrote to their friends
everywhere that 'Paris was supplied with three excellent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
preachers, announcing the truth ... with a
little more boldness than was customary.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_287" id="Ref_287" href="#Foot_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=ESSENCE OF EVANGELICAL PREACHING.=</p>

<p>Courault, a sincere scriptural christian, who did not
participate in Margaret's subtleties, preached at St.
Saviour's. The inhabitants of the quarter of St. Denis
and from other parts crowded to this church. Many
persons who had said of the preachings at the Louvre,
'They are not for us,' hastened to the place which belonged
to the people. The man who occupied the pulpit
was about the middle age; he did not possess Roussel's
grace, he was even somewhat rough, and preached the
Gospel without reserve and without disguise. His
lively and aggressive style, his expressive and rather
threatening gestures arrested attention. He attacked
unsparingly the errors of the Church and the vices
of christians. Courault did not come, as the Roman
preachers had done up to that very hour, to impose
on his hearers certain laws, ceremonies, and acts of
worship by means of which they could be reconciled
to God and merit his favour. He spoke not of feasts,
or of dedications, or of customs, or of those mechanical
prayers and chantings, in which the understanding
and the heart have no share, and with which
the Church burdened believers. He had a special
horror of all that mixes up the worship of the creature
with the adoration of God, and would not suffer the
perfect work of Christ to be obscured by the invocation
of other mediators. He preached that the true
worship of the New Testament was faith in the Gospel,
and the love which proceeds from faith; that it was
communion with Christ, patience under the cross, and
a holy activity in doing good, accompanied by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
constant prayers of the heart. This preaching, so
new in the capital, attracted an immense crowd. The
enthusiasm was universal. 'This man is in the first
rank among good men,' was the general opinion.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_288" id="Ref_288" href="#Foot_288">[288]</a></span>
'He is like a sentinel on a tower who, with his eyes
fixed on the east, proclaims that the sun, so long
hidden, will shine at last upon the earth.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_289" id="Ref_289" href="#Foot_289">[289]</a></span>
Light beamed from Courault's discourses. His sight was
weak, and in after years, during his exile in Switzerland,
where he was Calvin's colleague, he became
quite blind; but his language was always marked by
great clearness. It was said of him that 'although
blind he enlightens the soul.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_290" id="Ref_290" href="#Foot_290">[290]</a></span>
Among his hearers
was Louis du Tillet, Calvin's friend, and the youthful
canon was deeply excited by the living faith of the
aged Augustine. 'Oh! what piety I found in him!'
he exclaimed on a later occasion.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_291" id="Ref_291" href="#Foot_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>Berthaud, the other preacher named by the bishop,
subsequently deserted the Gospel and died a canon of
Besançon: so that each of them reminds us of our
Saviour's words: <i>There shall two be in the field; the
one shall be taken, and the other left</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_292" id="Ref_292" href="#Foot_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>These evangelical preachings in the palace of the
king and in the churches of Paris were important facts,
and there has been nothing like it since in France.
The alarm was consequently at its height. People
asked whether the sentinels of the Church were asleep,
and whether the bark of St. Peter would founder,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
while the Gospel ship seemed floating onwards in full
sail.</p>

<p class="side">=AGITATION OF THE SORBONNE.=</p>

<p>But the doctors of the Sorbonne were not asleep;
on the contrary, they were on the watch, they sent
their spies into the evangelical assemblies, received
their reports, and took counsel together every day.
The members of this society, the principal, the prior,
the senior, the recorder, the professors, the proctors,
and the librarians declared boldly and unanimously
that all was lost if they did not make haste to
check the evil. The evangelicals and the men of
letters were informed of these fanatical discussions.
'What a horde of scribes and pharisees!' they exclaimed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_293" id="Ref_293" href="#Foot_293">[293]</a></span>
But that did not stop the horde. 'What
must be done?' they asked; and Beda replied: 'Let
the preachers be seized and put to death like Berquin.'
Some, more moderate or more politic, knowing
that Roussel was preaching by order of the
king's sister, shrank from this proposal, fearing they
would offend their sovereign.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_294" id="Ref_294" href="#Foot_294">[294]</a></span>
'What foolish policy!'
exclaimed Beda, 'what ineffable cowardice!... Is
not the Sorbonne the oracle of Europe? Shall it render
ambiguous answers, like the pagan oracles of old?'</p>

<p>Beda prevailed, and Roussel was denounced to the
king. 'Apply to my chancellor,' said Francis, who
did not wish to say either yes or no. The Sorbonne
delegates then waited upon Duprat. 'Apply to the
bishop,' said the cardinal, who was afraid of displeasing
the king. The Sorbonnists went to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
diocesan, rather anxious about the reception they
would receive from him; and with good reason, for
the liberal Du Bellay only laughed at them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_295" id="Ref_295" href="#Foot_295">[295]</a></span>
The exasperated but indefatigable doctors now turned to
the first president, who was one of their party; but
that magistrate, believing the Sorbonne to be in disgrace,
was not anxious to support their cause. The
wrath of the doctors now became unbounded. Would
there no longer be any justice in France for the
champions of the papacy? The friends of letters,
who had carefully noted all these repulses, smiled at
the confusion of the priests; and Sturm in particular,
the reviver of learning at Strasburg, and now professor
at Paris, did not spare them: 'Look at these
<i>Thersites</i>!' he said, comparing them to the ugliest,
most cowardly, and most ridiculous of the Grecian
host at Troy. 'They are at the end of their tether
and cannot succeed,' continued Sturm; 'for those
who can help them will not, and those who will
cannot.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_296" id="Ref_296" href="#Foot_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctors of the Sorbonne now lost all moderation.
'The king,' said they, 'who publicly supports
the heretics, his sister and the Archbishop of Paris,
who protect them, are as guilty as they.' Orders
were sent through all the camp: every pulpit became a
volcano. Furious declamations, superstitious sermons,
scholastic discourses, violent and grotesque speeches—the
supporters of Rome made use of all. 'Do you
know what an heretical minister is?' asked a monk.
'He is a pig in a pulpit, decorated with cap and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
surplice, and preaching to a congregation ... of
asses.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_297" id="Ref_297" href="#Foot_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE FIREBRAND LE PICARD.=</p>

<p>The most active firebrand in this conflagration
was Le Picard, a bachelor of divinity, professor of the
college of Navarre, and subsequently dean of St.
Germain l'Auxerrois. He was twenty-nine years old,
of a 'stormy' temper if ever there was one, and in
truth he did 'storm' in the churches and at the
meetings of the priests. He went into the pulpit to
oppose Courault; and the people who had gone to
hear the Augustine monk, crowded also to hear his
opponent. The latter gesticulated much, shouted
loudly, invoked the Virgin, and attacked the king,
accusing him bluntly of heresy. He was a true
precursor of those who advised the massacre of St.
Bartholomew; and indeed he made a proposal, not
long after, worthy of the Guises and the Medici.
'Let the government pretend to be Lutheran,' he
said, 'in order that the reformed may assemble openly;
then we can fall upon them and clear the kingdom
of them once for all.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_298" id="Ref_298" href="#Foot_298">[298]</a></span>
A monk, charmed with his
virtues, has written his life under the title of <i>The
Perfect Ecclesiastic</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_299" id="Ref_299" href="#Foot_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=SEDITION OF BEDA AND MONKS.=</p>

<p>Yet if Le Picard was the most active champion,
Beda was still general. Placed as on a hill, he overlooked
the field of battle, examined where it was necessary
to send help, wrote every day to the orators of his
party—to Le Picard, Maillard, Ballue, Bouchigny, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
others, and conjured them not to relax for an instant in
their attacks. 'Stir up the people by your discourses,'
he said.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_300" id="Ref_300" href="#Foot_300">[300]</a></span>
It was a critical moment: it was in the
balance whether France would remain catholic or
become heretic. 'Though the monarch deserts the
papacy,' he said, 'agitate, still agitate!' Then the
fanatical monks went into the pulpits and aroused
the people by their fiery eloquence: 'Let us not
suffer this heresy, the most pestilential of all, to take
root among us.... Let us pluck it up, cast it out,
and annihilate it.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_301" id="Ref_301" href="#Foot_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>All the forces of the papacy were engaged at this
time as in a battle where the general launches his
reserves into the midst of the struggle. The mendicant
friars, those veteran soldiers of the popedom, who
had access into every family, were set to work.
Dominicans, Augustines, Carmelites, and Franciscans,
having received their instructions, entered the houses
of Paris. The women and children, who were used to
them, saluted them with 'Good morning, friar John or
friar James;' and while their wallet was being filled,
they whispered in the ears of the citizens: 'The pope
is above the king.... If the king favours the heretics,
the pope will free us from our oaths of fidelity.'</p>

<p>They went still further. Whenever it is felt desirable
to arouse the people, they require to be excited
by some spectacle. A <i>neuvaine</i> was ordered in honour
of St. James. The crowd flocked to adore the good
saint with his long pilgrim's staff; and for nine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
days the devout of both sexes, kneeling round his
image, crossing themselves and employing other usual
ceremonies, loudly called upon the saint to give a
knock-down blow with his staff to those who protected
the heretics.</p>

<p>These incendiary discourses and bigoted practices
succeeded. The people began to be restless and to
utter threats.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_302" id="Ref_302" href="#Foot_302">[302]</a></span>
They paraded in bands through the
streets, they collected in groups in the public places,
and cries were heard of: 'The pope for ever! down
with his enemies!... Whoever opposes the holy
father, even if he be a king, is a knave and a tyrant,
to whom the Grand Turk is preferable.... We will dye
our streets with the blood of those people.'... There
was already in the veins of the inhabitants of Paris the
blood of the men of the Reign of Terror. The crowds
who filled the streets stopped before the booksellers'
shops, where books and pictures, defamatory of the
reformers and even of the Queen of Navarre, were
displayed. Among the books was a 'stage play'
aimed at the king's sister: it was probably that entitled:
<i>The Malady of Christendom, with thirteen
characters</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_303" id="Ref_303" href="#Foot_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>But even that was not sufficient. There was still
wanting a theological decision from the first academical
authority of christendom, which should place Roussel
in the same rank as the arch-heretic Luther. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
Sorbonne, wishing to strike a decisive blow, published
a certain number of the so-called pernicious and scandalous
doctrines imputed to Roussel, and condemned
them as being similar to the errors of Luther. The
alarm and agitation were now at their height; the
people fancied they could see the monk of Wittemberg
breathing his impious doctrines over Paris. Rome
fought boldly, and everything was in confusion.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_304" id="Ref_304" href="#Foot_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>What became of Calvin during all this uproar?
'What is this madness,' he said on a later occasion,
'which impels the pope and his bishops, the priests
and the friars, to resist the Gospel with such obstinate
rebellion?... The servants of God must be furnished
with invincible constancy in order to sustain without
alarm the commotions of the people. We are sailing
on a sea exposed to many tempests; but nothing
ought to turn us aside from doing our duty conscientiously.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_305" id="Ref_305" href="#Foot_305">[305]</a></span>
The Lord consoles and strengthens his
servants when they are thus agitated.... He has in
his hand the management of every whirlwind and of
every storm, and appeases them whenever it seems
good to him.... We shall be roughly handled, but he
will not suffer us to be drowned.'<span

 <h3>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">DEFEAT OF THE ROMISH PARTY IN PARIS AND MOMENTARY
 TRIUMPH OF THE GOSPEL.<br />
 (1533.)</span></h3>

<p class="side">=FRANCIS PUNISHES BOTH PARTIES.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MARGARET and her husband, with the Bishop du
Bellay, alarmed at the storm, resolved to lay
their complaints before Francis I. The kingly authority
was threatened; these hot-headed 'wallet-bearers'
were the predecessors of those who instigated the
murders of Henry III. and Henry IV. The King of
Navarre on the one hand, and the Bishop of Paris
on the other, laid before their sovereign an alarming
picture of the state of the capital. 'The blood of
Berquin does not satisfy these fanatics,' they said; 'they
are calling for fresh acts of cruelty.... And who will
be their victims now?... They are planning a crime,
a revolt!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_307" id="Ref_307" href="#Foot_307">[307]</a></span>
But while Francis was listening to his
sister's denunciations with one ear, he was receiving
those of the Sorbonne in the other. 'Sedition!' said
one party. 'Heresy!' cried the other. 'Sire,' repeated
the theologians incessantly, 'shut the pulpits against
Roussel and his colleagues.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_308" id="Ref_308" href="#Foot_308">[308]</a></span>
Thus pulled in different
directions, the king, puzzled which to believe, resolved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
to punish both parties alike. 'I will confine them all
to their houses,' he said; 'Beda with his orators on
one side, and Gerard Roussel with his preachers on the
other. We shall then have some peace and be able at
our leisure to examine these contradictory accusations.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_309" id="Ref_309" href="#Foot_309">[309]</a></span>
Thus, at the same moment, Beda, Maillard,
Ballue, and Bouchigny of the church party, and
Roussel, Courault, and Berthaud of the evangelical
party, received orders not to leave their houses. The
schoolmaster thus punished the quarrelsome boys
by putting them in opposite corners.</p>

<p>Preparations were made for investigating the two
cases, but the matter was not so easy as the king had
imagined. The theologians were indignant at finding
themselves placed in the same rank with the Lutherans.
Far from submitting to be prosecuted for sedition, they
claimed to prosecute the others for heresy. They
would not be the accused or even the accusers; they
took their stand as inquisitors of the faith and as
judges.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_310" id="Ref_310" href="#Foot_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=BEDA BREAKS LOOSE.=</p>

<p>The terrible Beda, shut up in the college of
Montaigu,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_311" id="Ref_311" href="#Foot_311">[311]</a></span>
 and not daring to go out, found himself
condemned, considering his restless temper, to the
severest penance. At first he was content to keep
his agents at work, who were ready at any moment to
bear his orders. But when he learnt that his right to
judge was disputed, and that he was to be put in the
same rank with Roussel, the turbulent doctor could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
restrain himself no longer. His room was too narrow
to contain his anger. He made light of the king's
commands, and, disobeying his orders, mounted his
mule and rode into the city. From time to time he
stopped. The catholic tribune, the defender of the
pope, was soon recognised; a crowd gathered round
him; he addressed the people from his mule, and did
his best to arouse their fanatical passions. While the
catholics flocked round him, some evangelicals were
watching the orator and his audience from a distance.
'I saw him riding on his mule,' says Siderander.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_312" id="Ref_312" href="#Foot_312">[312]</a></span>
Beda thought himself stronger than the king, and in
some respects he was; he reigned over the savage
appetites of an ignorant and fanatical populace. Such
was the power in the sixteenth century by which the
pope triumphed more than once in the capital of
France and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Beda was vigorously supported by all his subalterns:
Le Picard especially, who had not been put
under arrest, expressed his indignation in his fanatical
discourses that the king should desire to hold the
balance even between the Church and heresy; and
advocated a resort to force to insure the triumph of
the oppressed papacy. A riot seemed about to break
out. The friends of learning and of the king were
alarmed. Might not the Roman party take advantage
of Francis's absence to establish another power than
his in Paris, and to treat this monarch as the Seize in
after years treated his grandson Henry III.?</p>

<p>The King of Navarre and the Bishop of Paris
hastened to Meaux, where Francis was staying with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
his court, and informed him that Beda, Le Picard, and
their colleagues had thrown aside all reserve, and that,
unless energetic measures were taken, the public tranquillity
and perhaps his crown might be endangered.
The king gave way to a paroxysm of anger. Beda's
freak of parading the streets of Paris on his mule,
notwithstanding the prohibition, was one of those
insults that Francis felt very keenly. He ordered
Cardinal Duprat and the Bishop of Senlis to make all
haste to Paris, and stop the intrigues of the Sorbonne
and the promenades of Beda, and also arrest Le
Picard. 'As for the inquiry about heresy,' said the
king, 'I reserve that for myself.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_313" id="Ref_313" href="#Foot_313">[313]</a></span>
Heresy was treated
with more tenderness than the first catholic faculty of
christendom. Francis began to find the Lutherans
gentle as lambs in comparison with the hot-headed
papists. Certain personages, whose arrival was soon
to be announced by the officers of his court, confirmed
him in this opinion.</p>

<p class="side">=SORBONNE THREATENS FRANCIS.=</p>

<p>Scarcely had the two prelates left Meaux, when a
deputation from the Sorbonne arrived. When Francis
received them, he was evidently in a bad humour, but
he did not address them sharply, as the courtiers had
expected. The theologians approached him with all
the required formalities; they desired, if possible, to
win him by meekness. But by degrees they raised
their tone; they beset him with their accusations, and
irritated him with their pretensions, repeating again
and again that it was the prerogative of the Sorbonne,
and not of the prince, to give their opinion in a matter
of heresy. There was some truth in this, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
truth did not please Francis, who claimed to be master
in everything. Still he contained himself, until the
doctors, coming to threats of revolt, and shouting their
loudest, reminded him of the possibility of a deposition
of kings by the popes.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_314" id="Ref_314" href="#Foot_314">[314]</a></span>
These recollections of the
middle ages, with which they menaced the haughty
monarch, who claimed to begin a new era, and who
desired that the Reformation should serve at least to
abate the pretensions of Rome, and emancipate princes
from its yoke, made the king shudder, and aroused a
terrible fit of anger. His face grew red, his eyes flashed
fire, and putting aside his usual courtesy, he drove the
reverend fathers from his presence, calling them beasts,
and saying: 'Get about your business, you donkeys!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_315" id="Ref_315" href="#Foot_315">[315]</a></span>
At this moment Francis inaugurated modern times—though
certainly in a fashion rather cavalier.</p>

<p>However, Cardinal Duprat was on the road. What
would he do, this vile courtier of the popes, who
at their demand had destroyed the bulwark of the
Gallican liberties, and who hated the Reformation?
The Sorbonne placed their hope in him. But Duprat
served his master before all things, and he could not
hide from himself that the hot-headed catholics were
threatening the king's crown. He resolved to strike
heavily. As soon as he reached Paris, he had Le
Picard arrested, as being the most compromised. He
confined him in his own palace, seized his books and
papers, and had him interrogated by the advocate-general.
The seditious bachelor raved in his prison,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
and protested aloud against the indignity of such
treatment; but all his storming was of no use. He was
condemned to be shut up in the abbey of St. Magloire,
and forbidden to teach.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_316" id="Ref_316" href="#Foot_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor did Duprat stop here. He was shocked that
paltry priests should dare speak against that royal
majesty of Francis I. for which he, a cardinal and
chancellor, had nothing but humble flatteries. He
never ceased to be the mortal enemy of the Gospel,
and originated many a measure of persecution against
the reformed; but his chief quality was a slavish
devotion to the wishes of his master. To the mendicant
monks sent out by the Sorbonne he opposed
'inquirers'—the name he gave to the spies who were
in every parish, and who skilfully interrogated men
and women, nobles and sacristans, to find out whether
the preachers or the friars had attacked the king's
government in their hearing. Many of the townspeople
were unwilling to say anything; yet the
clever and dreaded minister attained his ends, and
having discovered the most refractory priests, he
summoned them before him. This summons from a
cardinal of the holy Church, from the most powerful
person in the kingdom, alarmed these violent clerics;
on a sudden their courage collapsed, and they appeared
before his eminence with downcast eyes, trembling
limbs, and confused manner. 'Who permitted or
who authorised you to insult the king and to excite
the people?' asked the haughty Duprat.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_317" id="Ref_317" href="#Foot_317">[317]</a></span>
The priests
were too much terrified to conceal anything: 'It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
with the consent and the good pleasure of our reverend
masters,' they replied.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_318" id="Ref_318" href="#Foot_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>The theologians of the Sorbonne were now summoned
in their turn. They were quite as much
alarmed as their creatures, and, seeing the danger,
denied everything.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_319" id="Ref_319" href="#Foot_319">[319]</a></span>
They managed to take shelter
behind certain clever reservations: they had <i>hinted</i>
the insult, but they had not <i>commanded</i> it. At heart
both chiefs and followers were all equally fanatical, and
not one of them needed any stimulus to do his duty
in this holy war. These reverend gentlemen, having
thus screened themselves under denials, withdrew,
fully convinced that no one would dare lay hands
upon them. But a hundred Bedas would not have
stopped the terrible cardinal. In the affair of the
concordat, had he taken any notice of the fierce
opposition of the sovereign courts, of the universities,
or even of the clergy of France? Duprat smiled at
his own unpopularity, and found a secret pleasure in
attracting the general hatred upon himself. Catholics
and evangelicals—he will brave and crush them all.
He went to the bottom of the matter, and having
discovered who were the Æoluses that had raised
these sacerdotal tempests, he informed the king of the
result.</p>

<p class="side">=FRANCIS ACTS VIGOROUSLY.=</p>

<p>Francis had never been so angry with the catholics.
He had met with men who dared resist him!... It
was his pride, his despotism, and not his love of truth,
that was touched. Besides, was he not the ally of
Henry VIII., and was he not seeking to form a league
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
with the protestants of Germany? Severe measures
against the ultramontane bigots would convince his
allies of the sincerity of his words. He had another
motive still: Francis highly valued the title 'patron
of letters,' and he looked upon the friars as their
enemy. He put himself forward as the champion of
the learning of the age, and not of the Gospel; but for
a moment it was possible to believe in the triumph
of the Reformation under the patronage of the
Renaissance.</p>

<p class="side">=CONDEMNATION OF BEDA.=</p>

<p>On the 16th of May, 1533, the indefatigable Beda,
the fiery Le Picard, and the zealous friar Mathurin,
the three most intrepid supporters of the papacy in
France, appeared before the parliament. An event so
extraordinary filled both university and city with
surprise and emotion. Devout men raised their eyes
to heaven; devout women redoubled their prayers to
Mary; but Beda and his two colleagues, proud of their
Romish orthodoxy, appeared before the court, and compared
themselves with the confessors of Christ standing
before the proconsuls of Rome. No one could believe
in a condemnation; was not the King of France
the eldest son of the Church? But the disciples of
the pope did not know the monarch who then reigned
over France. If they wanted to show what a priest
was like, the sovereign wanted to show what a king
was like. When signing the letters-royal in which
Francis had suggested the arrest to parliament, he
exclaimed: 'As for Beda, on my word, he shall never
return to Paris!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_320" id="Ref_320" href="#Foot_320">[320]</a></span>
The king's ordinance had been
duly registered; the court was complete; and not a
sound could be heard, when the president, turning to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
the three doctors, said: 'Reverend gentlemen, you
are banished from Paris, and will henceforward live
thirty leagues from this capital; you are at liberty,
however, to select what residences you please, provided
they be at a distance from each other. You
will leave the city in twenty-four hours. If you break
your ban, you will incur the penalty of death. You
will neither preach, give lessons, nor hold any kind of
meeting, and you will keep up no communication with
one another, until the king has ordered otherwise.'</p>

<p>Beda, Le Picard, Mathurin, and their friends, were
all terrified. Francis had, however, reserved for the
last a decision which must have abated their courage
still more. As if he wished to show the triumph of
evangelical ideas, he cancelled the injunction against
Roussel; and Margaret's almoner was able once more
to preach the Gospel in the capital. 'If you have any
complaint against him,' said the king to the Sorbonne,
'you can bring him before the lawful tribunals.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_321" id="Ref_321" href="#Foot_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>This decree of the parliament fell like a thunderbolt
in the midst of the Sorbonne. Stunned and stupefied,
unable to say or do anything, the doctors shook off
their stupor only to be seized with a fit of terror.
They visited each other, conversed together, and whispered
their alarms. Had the fatal moment really come
which they had feared so long? Was Francis about
to follow the example of Frederick of Saxony and
Henry of England? Would the cause of the holy
Roman Church perish under the attacks of its enemies?
Would France join the triumphal procession of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
Reformation?... The old men, pretty numerous at
the Sorbonne, were overwhelmed. One of them, a
broken-down, feeble hypochondriac, was so terribly
disturbed by the decree, that he fairly lost his senses.
He suffered a perpetual nightmare. He fancied he
saw the king and the parliament, with all France, destroying
the Sorbonne, and trampling on the necks of
the doctors while their palace was burning. The poor
man expired in the midst of these terrible phantoms.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_322" id="Ref_322" href="#Foot_322">[322]</a></span>
Yet the blow which stunned some, aroused others.
The more intrepid doctors met and conferred together,
and strove to encourage their partisans and to enlist
new ones: they took no rest night or day.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_323" id="Ref_323" href="#Foot_323">[323]</a></span>
Unable
to believe that this decree really expressed the king's
will, they determined to send a deputation to the
south of France, whither he had gone; but Francis
had not forgotten their hint about the deposition of
kings by the popes, and, angry as ever, he rejected
every demand.</p>

<p class="side">=HOPES OF THE REFORMERS.=</p>

<p>Nor was the Sorbonne alone agitated: all the city
was in commotion, some being against the decree,
others for it. The bigots, in their compassion for 'the
excellent Beda,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_324" id="Ref_324" href="#Foot_324">[324]</a></span>
exclaimed: 'What an indignity, to
expose so profound a divine, so high-born a man, to
such a harsh punishment!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_325" id="Ref_325" href="#Foot_325">[325]</a></span>
 But, on the other hand,
the friends of learning leapt for joy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_326" id="Ref_326" href="#Foot_326">[326]</a></span>
A great movement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
seemed to be accomplishing; it was a solemn
time. Some of the most intelligent men imagined
that France was about to be regenerated and transformed....
Sturm in his college was delighted. What
news to send to Germany, to Bucer, to Melanchthon!...
He ran to his study, took up his pen, and wrote in his
transport: 'Things are changing, the hinges are turning....
It is true there still remain here and there
a few aged Priams, surrounded by servile creatures,
who cling to the things that are passing away.... But,
with the exception of this small number of belated
men, no one any longer defends the cause of the
Phrygian priests.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_327" id="Ref_327" href="#Foot_327">[327]</a></span>
The classic Sturm could only
compare the spirit of the ultramontanists to the superstition
and fanaticism of the priests of Phrygia, so
notorious for those qualities in ancient times. But the
friends of the Reform and of the Renaissance were
indulging in most exaggerated illusions. A few old
folks, mumbling their <i>Ave-Marias</i> and <i>Pater-nosters</i>,
seemed to them to constitute the whole strength of the
papacy. They had great hopes of the new generation:
'The young priests,' they said, 'are rushing into the
shining paths of wisdom.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_328" id="Ref_328" href="#Foot_328">[328]</a></span>
Francis I. having shown
an angry face to the Sorbonne, every Frenchman was
about to follow his example, according to the belief
of the friends of letters. They indulged in transports
of joy, and, as it were, a universal shout welcomed the
opening of a new era. But alas! France was still far
distant from it; she was not judged worthy of such
happiness. Instead of seeing the triple banner of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
Gospel, morality, and liberty raised upon her walls,
that great and mighty nation was destined, owing to
Romish influence, to pass through centuries of despotism
and wild democracy, frivolity and licentiousness,
superstition and unbelief.</p>

<p class="side">=THE FOUR DOCTORS EXILED.=</p>

<p>In the midst of the contrary movements now agitating
Paris, there was a certain number of spectators
who, while leaning more to one party than to the
other, set about studying the situation. In one of the
colleges was a student of Alsace, the son of an ironmonger
at Strasburg, who, wishing to give himself a
Greek or Latin name, called himself <i>Siderander</i>, 'man
of iron.' Such, however, was not his nature; he was
particularly curious; he had a passion for picking up
news, and his great desire to know other people's
business made him supple as the willow, rather than
hard as the metal. Siderander was an amiable well-educated
young man, and he gives us a pretty faithful
picture of the better class of students of that day.
On Monday, May 26, he was going to hear a lecture
on logic by Sturm, who, leaving the paths of barren
scholasticism, was showing by example as well as by
precept how clearness of thought may be united
with elegance of language. Just as the Alsatian was
approaching the college of Montaigu, where Sturm
lectured, he met with a piece of good-luck. He saw
an immense crowd of students and citizens collected
in front of the college, where they had been waiting
since the morning to witness the departure of the
Hercules of the Sorbonne.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_329" id="Ref_329" href="#Foot_329">[329]</a></span>
He ran as fast as he
could, his heart throbbing with joy at the thought of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
seeing Beda, the great papist, going into banishment....
For such a sight, the student would have walked
from Strasburg. The rumour had spread through
Paris that the three or four disgraced doctors were to
leave the capital on that day. Everybody wished to
see them: some for the joy they felt at their disgrace;
others, to give vent to their sorrow. But, sad misfortune!
the lucky chance which had delighted the
student failed him. The government was alarmed,
and fearing a riot, the exiles did not appear. The
crowd was forced to disperse without seeing them, and
Siderander went away in great disappointment. The
next morning, at an early hour, the four culprits, Beda,
Le Picard, Mathurin, and a Franciscan, came forth
under guard and without noise. The doctors, humiliated
at being led out of the city like malefactors,
did not even raise their heads. But the precautions
of the police were useless: many people were on the
look-out, the news spread in a moment through the
quarter, and a crowd of burgesses, monks, and common
people filled the streets to see the celebrated theologians
pass, dejected, silent, and with downcast eyes.
The glory of the Sorbonne had faded; even that of
Rome was dimmed; and it seemed to many as if the
papacy was departing with its four defenders. The
devout catholics gave way to sighs and groans, indignation
and tears; but at the very moment when these
bigots were paying the last honours to popery, others
were saluting the advent of the new times with transports
of joy. 'They are sycophants,' said some
among the crowd, 'banished from Paris on account of
their lies and their traitorous proceedings.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_330" id="Ref_330" href="#Foot_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></div>

<p>The disciples of the Gospel did not confine themselves
to words. Matters were in good train, and it was
desirable to persevere until the end was reached. While
the Sorbonne bent its head, the Reformation was looking
up. The Queen of Navarre and her husband, with
many politicians and men of rank, encouraged Roussel,
Courault, and others to preach the Gospel fearlessly;
even these evangelists were astonished at their sudden
favour. Roussel in particular advanced timidly, asking
whether the Church would not interpose its <i>veto</i>?
But no; Bishop du Bellay, the diplomatist's brother,
did not interfere. During the whole period of the
king's absence, Paris was almost like a country in the
act of reforming itself. Men thought themselves
already secure of that religious liberty which, alas!
was to cost three centuries of struggle and the purest
blood, and whose lamentable defeats were to scatter
the confessors of Jesus Christ into every part of the
world. When a great good is to be bestowed on the
human race, the deliverance is only accomplished by
successive efforts. But at this time men thought they
had attained the end at a single bound. From the
pulpits that were opened to them in every quarter of
Paris, the evangelists proclaimed that the truth had
been revealed in Jesus Christ; that the Word of God,
contained in the writings of the prophets and apostles,
did not require to be sanctioned or interpreted by an
infallible authority; and that whoever listened to it or
read it with a sincere heart, would be enlightened and
saved by it. The tutelage of the priests was abolished,
and emancipated souls were brought into immediate
contact with God and his revelation. The great
salvation purchased by the death of Christ upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
cross was announced with power, and the friends of
the Gospel, transported with joy, exclaimed: 'At last
Christ is preached publicly in the pulpits of the
capital, and all speak of it freely.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_331" id="Ref_331" href="#Foot_331">[331]</a></span>
May the Lord
increase among us day by day the glory of his
Gospel!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_332" id="Ref_332" href="#Foot_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=SATIRES OF THE STUDENTS.=</p>

<p>The most serious causes always find defenders
among trivial men, who do not thoroughly understand
them, but yet despise their adversaries. The
Reformation has no reason to be proud of some of its
auxiliaries in the sixteenth century. A serious cause
ought to be seriously defended; but history cannot
pass by these manifestations, which are as much in her
domain as those of another kind. Satire was not spared
in this matter. The students especially delighted
in it: they posted up a long placard, written carefully
with ornamented letters in French verse, in which
the four theologians were described in the liveliest and
most fantastic colours.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_333" id="Ref_333" href="#Foot_333">[333]</a></span>
Two of their colleagues were
also introduced, for the four doctors on whom the
king's wrath had fallen were not the only criminals.
A cordelier especially was notorious for his curious
sermons, full of bad French and bad Latin, and still
more notorious for the clever and popular eloquence
he displayed, whenever a collection was to be made in
favour of his order. This Pierre Cornu, who had
been nicknamed <i>des Cornes</i>, was wonderfully touched
off in the poem of the students. Groups of scholars,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
burgesses, and Parisian wits gathered round the
placards, some bursting with laughter and others with
anger. The vehement and ridiculous Cornu especially
excited the mirth of the idlers. A profane author
who had nothing to do with the Reformation, speaks
of him in his writings:—'Ha! ha! Master Cornu,'
said one, 'you are not the only man to have horns....
Friend Bacchus wears a pair; and so do Pan, and
Jupiter Ammon and hosts besides.'—'Ha! ha! dear
Master Cornibus,' said another, 'give me an ounce of
your sermon, and I will make the collection in your
parish.' Strange circumstance! The public voice
seemed at this time opposed to these forerunners of
the preachers of the League. The Sorbonne, however,
had friends who replied to these jests by bursts of
passion. 'The man who wrote these verses is a
heretic,' they exclaimed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_334" id="Ref_334" href="#Foot_334">[334]</a></span>
From insults they passed
to threats; from threats they came to blows, and the
struggle began. The bigots wished to pull down
the placard. A creature of the Faculty succeeded;
springing into the air, he tore it down and ran off
with his spoil.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_335" id="Ref_335" href="#Foot_335">[335]</a></span>
Then the crowd dispersed.</p>

<p class="side">=SORBONNE CALLS FOR THE STAKE.=</p>

<p>In that age placards played a great part, similar
to that played by certain pamphlets in later times.
There was no need to buy them at the bookseller's;
everybody could read the impromptu tracts at the
corners of the streets. Rome was not in the humour
to leave these powerful weapons in the hands of her
enemies, and the Sorbonne determined to appeal to
the people against the abhorred race of innovators. It
did not jest, like the youth of the schools; it went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
straight to the point, and invoked the stake against
its adversaries. Two days after that on which the
former placard was posted up, another was found on
the walls, containing these unpolished verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To the stake! to the stake! with the heretic crew,</div>
<div class="verse">That day and night vexes all good men and true.</div>
<div class="verse">Shall we let them Saint Scripture and her edicts defile?</div>
<div class="verse">Shall we banish pure science for Lutherans vile?</div>
<div class="verse">Do you think that our God will permit such as these</div>
<div class="verse">To imperil our bodies and souls at their ease?</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">O Paris, of cities the flower and the pride,</div>
<div class="verse">Uphold that true faith which these heretics deride;</div>
<div class="verse">Or else on thy towers storm and tempest shall fall....</div>
<div class="verse">Take heed by my warning; and let us pray all</div>
<div class="verse">That the King of all kings will be pleased to confound</div>
<div class="verse">These dogs so accursed, where'er they be found,</div>
<div class="verse">That their names, like bones going fast to decay,</div>
<div class="verse">May from memory's tablets be clean wiped away.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To the stake! to the stake! the fire is their home!</div>
<div class="verse">As God hath permitted, let justice be done.</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>A crowd equally great assembled before this placard,
as cruel as it was crafty. The writer appealed
to the people of Paris; he entitled them 'the flower
and pride of cities,' knowing that flattery is the
best means of winning men's minds; and then he
called for the stake. The 'stake' was the argument
with which men opposed the Reform. 'Burn those
who confute us!' This savage invocation was a
home-thrust. Many of the citizens, kneeling down to
write, copied out the placard, in order to carry it to
every house: the press is less rapid, even in our
days. Others committed the verses to memory, and
walked along the streets singing the burden:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To the stake! to the stake! the fire is their home!</div>
<div class="verse">As God hath permitted, let justice be done.</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></div>

<p>These rude rhymes became the motto of their
party; this cruel ballad of the sixteenth century erelong
summoned the champions of the Church in
various quarters to fatten the earth with the ashes of
their enemies. Pierre Siderander happened to be in
the crowd; noticing several papists copying the incendiary
verses, the Strasburg student did the same,
and sent copies to his friends. By this means they
were handed down to our times.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_336" id="Ref_336" href="#Foot_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day there was a fresh placard. The Sorbonne,
finding the people beginning to be moved,
wished to arouse them thoroughly. This ballad was
not confined to a general appeal to the stake; Roussel
was mentioned by name as one who deserved to be
burnt. The fanatical placards of the Sorbonnists
were not so soon torn down as the satirical couplets
of their pupils. They could be read for days together,
such good watch did the sacristans keep over
them.</p>

<p>But the Sorbonne did not limit themselves to a
paper war; they worked upon the most eminent
members of the parliament. Their zeal displayed
itself on every side. 'Justice! justice!' they exclaimed;
'let us punish these detestable heretics,
and pluck up Lutheranism, root and branch.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_337" id="Ref_337" href="#Foot_337">[337]</a></span>
The whole city was in commotion; the most odious plots
were concocted; and the <i>matéologues</i>, as the students
called the defenders of the old abuses, took counsel at
the Sorbonne every day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=PROGRESS OF THE REFORM.=</p>

<p>In the midst of all this agitation the Reformation
was advancing quietly but surely. While the Queen
of Navarre boldly professed her living piety in the
palace, and preachers proclaimed it from their pulpits
to the believing crowd, evangelical men, still in obscurity,
were modestly propagating around them a
purer and a mightier faith. At this period Calvin
spent four years in Paris (1529-1533), where he at
first engaged in literature. It might have been thought
that he would appear in the world as a man of letters,
and not as a reformer. But he soon placed profane
studies in the second rank, and devoted himself to
the service of God, as we have seen. He would have
desired not to enter forthwith upon a career of evangelical
activity. 'During this time,' he said, 'my sole
object was to live privately, without being known.'
He felt the necessity of a time of silence and christian
meditation. He would have liked to imitate Paul,
who, after his conversion and his first preaching at
Damascus, passed several quiet years in Arabia and
Cilicia;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_338" id="Ref_338" href="#Foot_338">[338]</a></span>
but he had to combat error around him,
and he soon took a step in advance. While Courault
and Roussel were preaching in the churches to large
audiences and dealing tenderly with the papacy,
Calvin, displaying great activity,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_339" id="Ref_339" href="#Foot_339">[339]</a></span> visited the different
quarters of Paris where secret assemblies were
held, and there proclaimed a more scriptural, a more
complete, and a bolder doctrine. In his discourses
he made frequent allusions to the dangers to which
those were exposed who desired to live piously; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
he taught them at the same time 'what magnanimity
believers ought to possess when adversity draws
them on to despair.'—'When things do not go as we
wish,' he said, 'sadness comes over the mind and
makes us forget all our confidence. But the paternal
love of God is the foundation of an invincible strength
which overcomes every trial. The divine favour is
a shelter against all storms, from whatever quarter
they may come.' And he usually ended his discourses,
we are told, with these words: '<i>If God be
for us, who can be against us?</i>'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_340" id="Ref_340" href="#Foot_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>Mere preaching did not satisfy Calvin: he entered
into communication with all who desired a purer
religion,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_341" id="Ref_341" href="#Foot_341">[341]</a></span>
made them frequent visits, and conversed
seriously with them. He avoided no one, and
cultivated the friendship of those whom he had
formerly known. He advanced step by step, but he
was always busy, and the doctrine of the Gospel
made some progress every day. All persons rendered
the strongest testimony to his piety.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_342" id="Ref_342" href="#Foot_342">[342]</a></span>
The friends of the Word of God gathered round him,
and among them were many burgesses and common
people, but there were nobles and college professors
also.</p>

<p>These christians were full of hope, and even Calvin
entertained the bold idea of winning the king, the university,
and indeed France herself, over to the Gospel.
Paris was in suspense. Every one thought that some
striking and perhaps sudden change was about to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
take place in one direction or another. Will Rome
or will the Reformation have the advantage? There
were strong reasons for adopting the former opinion,
and reasons hardly less powerful for adopting the
latter. Discussions arose upon this point, even
among friends. Men were on the look-out for anything
that might help them to divine the future, and
the more curious resorted to the various places where
they hoped to pick up news. Public attention was
particularly turned towards the Sorbonne, when it
was known that the heads of the Roman party were
holding council.</p>

<p class="side">=PIERRE SIDERANDER.=</p>

<p>On the 23rd of May, 1533, Pierre Siderander (who
was naturally inquisitive), instigated by a desire to
learn what was going to happen, and wishing in
particular to know what was doing in the theological
clubs (for from them, he doubted not, would proceed
the blow that would decide who should be the victors),
stole into the buildings belonging to the faculty of
divinity.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_343" id="Ref_343" href="#Foot_343">[343]</a></span>
He did not dare penetrate farther than
the great gate: stopping there like any other lounger,
he began to look at the pictures that were sold at the
entrance of the building.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_344" id="Ref_344" href="#Foot_344">[344]</a></span>
But, with all his innocent
air, his eyes and ears were wide open, trying to pick
up a word or two that would tell him what was going
on; for the doctors, as they went in or out talking
together, must necessarily pass close by him. Pierre
wasted his time sauntering about before the pictures
of the saints and of the Virgin (which he looked upon
as idolatrous). On a sudden he saw the illustrious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
Budæus coming out of the Sorbonne.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_345" id="Ref_345" href="#Foot_345">[345]</a></span>
At that time
Budæus was playing the same part as the noble Chancellor
l'Hôpital afterwards did: he was present in every
place where it was necessary to moderate, enlighten,
or restrain the hot-headed. He passed Siderander
without saying a word, and quitted the building; but
the curious student could not resist; he left his post
and began to follow the celebrated hellenist, wishing
to look at him at his ease, and hoping no doubt to
learn something.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_346" id="Ref_346" href="#Foot_346">[346]</a></span>
'Am I not,' he said, 'the friend
of his two sons who like myself attend the course
of Latomus? Has not the eldest invited me to come
and see his museum?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_347" id="Ref_347" href="#Foot_347">[347]</a></span>
Did not I go there the other
day, and ought he not to return my visit along with
his brother?' Siderander, who burnt with desire to
know what was said in the assembly which the
founder of the college of France had just left, quickened
his pace; the words were already on his lips,
when he suddenly stopped intimidated. Timidity
was stronger than curiosity, and he soon lost sight
of the man whom Erasmus called 'the prodigy of
France.' And yet, had he asked him, he would perhaps
have learnt what the Roman party was plotting,
and been able to tell his friends the probable
issue of the crisis. He had often asked the sons of
Budæus what their father was planning.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_348" id="Ref_348" href="#Foot_348">[348]</a></span>
'He is
much with the bishop,' answered they, 'but he is
planning nothing.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_349" id="Ref_349" href="#Foot_349">[349]</a></span>
Thus Siderander did all he could,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
but to no purpose, to elicit some interesting communication
and to learn some rare news. He was
unable to satisfy his extreme curiosity. 'And that is
not all,' he said to himself, 'for if, instead of losing my
time under the portico of the Sorbonne, I had been
elsewhere, I might have learnt something.' He desired
to be everywhere, and yet was nowhere. 'Ha!' he
said with vexation as he returned from running after
Budæus, 'while I throw my hook in at one place, the
fish goes to another. Things occur in our quarter
which the inhabitants of the others know nothing
about, and we know nothing of what takes place elsewhere.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_350" id="Ref_350" href="#Foot_350">[350]</a></span>
Alas! everything assumes a threatening
aspect; everything announces a violent storm.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_351" id="Ref_351" href="#Foot_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=SIDERANDER'S CURIOSITY.=</p>

<p>The Sorbonne, the religious orders, and all fervent
catholics, being convinced that the innovators, by
exalting Jesus Christ and his Word, were humbling
the Church and the papacy, were determined to wage
a deadly war against them. They thought that if
they first struck down the most formidable of their
adversaries, they could easily disperse the rest of the
rebel army. But against whom should the first blow
be aimed? This was the subject of deliberation in
those councils which the curious Siderander desired
so much to overhear.</p>

<p>Before we learn what was preparing at the Sorbonne,
we must enter more illustrious council-chambers, and
transport ourselves to Bologna.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">CONFERENCE OF BOLOGNA. THE COUNCIL AND CATHERINE DE MEDICI.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Winter 1532-1533.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE emperor, having descended the Italian slopes
of the Alps and crossed the north of Italy, arrived
at Bologna on the 5th of December, 1532, somewhat
annoyed at the escape of Duke Christopher, but not
suspecting that it would lead to any serious consequences.
This city, afterwards made famous by Guido,
Domenichino, the two Caracci, and by Benedict XIV.,
one of the most distinguished popes of the eighteenth
century, grew more animated every day. The pope
had arrived there: princes, nobles, prelates, and courtiers
filled its splendid palaces; a new world was in
motion around the churches, the Asinelli, the fountain
of Neptune, and the other monuments which adorn
that ancient city. The emperor had desired a conference
with the pope, with the intention of uniting
closely with him, and through him with the other
catholic princes, to act together against their two
enemies, France and the Reformation. But Charles
was mistaken if he thought to find himself alone with
the pope at Bologna. He was to meet with opponents
who would hold their own against him: a struggle
was about to begin around Clement VII. between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
France and the empire. Francis I., who had just had
a conference with Henry VIII., did not care, indeed,
to meet Charles; but his place in Italy was to be
supplied by men who would do his work better than
he could do it himself. On the 4th of January, 1533,
Cardinals de Tournon and de Gramont, sent by Francis
to Clement to threaten him with a certain 'great
injury' which he might have cause to regret for ever,
arrived in this city. Would the presence of the two
cardinals thwart Charles's plans?</p>

<p class="side">=PLANS OF CHARLES V.=</p>

<p>The first point which the emperor desired to carry
was the convocation of a general council. A grave
man and always occupied with business, he possessed
a soul greedy of dominion. Ferdinand and Isabella
having founded their power in Spain by restoring that
country to unity, he desired to do in central Europe
what they had done in the peninsula, that is, unite
it under his patronage, if not under his sceptre. And
lo! Germany is suddenly broken in his hands and
divided into two parts. Sad humiliation! When he
had crossed the Alps, after Soliman's retreat, he had
no longer that unlimited confidence in his genius and
authority which he had felt two years before, when
going to the diet of Augsburg. He had come from Spain
to crush that new sect which thwarted the dreams of
his ambition; and instead of crushing it, he had been
forced to recognise it. After the retreat of the Turks,
Charles found himself at the head of a numerous and
triumphant army, and men asked one another if he
would not fall upon the protestants with it; but the
best soldiers of that army were protestant themselves.
Other means must be resorted to in order to bring
the schism to an end. He weighed everything carefully,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
and brought to this business that nice and calm
attention which always distinguished him. Knowing
that the result of an appeal to arms was uncertain,
and that instead of restoring concord he might stir up
a hatred that nothing could extinguish, he decided in
favour of a council to restore unity, and made his
demand to the pope at Bologna. But Clement VII.
feared a council as much as Charles desired it. 'They
would want to redress grievances,' he said to his confidants,
'and reform abuses, quite as much as to extirpate
heresy.' Possessing great intelligence and rare
ability, vain, cunning, false, and with no elevation of
soul, Clement determined to put off this assembly
indefinitely, although always promising it. While the
emperor recognised the inefficiency of temporal arms,
the pope felt still more keenly the inefficiency of spiritual
arms. Each of these two personages distrusted
the power of which he had most experience. The
humble Gospel of the reformers intimidated both
Church and Empire. Clement conferred on the subject
with the Archbishop of Cortona, governor of Bologna,
with the legate Campeggio, and with the nuncio Gambara:
all agreed with him, and declared that to desire
to bring back protestants to the Romish faith otherwise
than by force was a very perilous enterprise.</p>

<p class="side">=CLEMENT AGAINST A COUNCIL.=</p>

<p>As, however, neither the pope nor the emperor
would give way, they desired a conference, at which
each would endeavour to convince the other. A
day, therefore, was appointed, and the two potentates
met in the palace of Bologna. Charles represented to
Clement, that 'a great number of catholics desired
and demanded a council as necessary to destroy the
heresy of Luther, which was gaining strength every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
day, and to suppress the numerous disorders that
existed in the Church.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_352" id="Ref_352" href="#Foot_352">[352]</a></span>
But the pope replied: 'If we
assemble a council, and permit the protestants to be
present and to question the doctrines sanctioned by
the Church, they will attack them all, and numberless
innovations will be the result. If, on the contrary,
we do not allow them to speak, they will say that they
are condemned unheard; they will leave the assembly,
and the world will believe that we are in the wrong.
As the protestants reject the decisions of past councils,
how can we hope that they will respect the decisions
of future councils? Do we not know their obstinacy?
When we put forward the authority of the Church,
do they not set the authority of Holy Scripture in its
place? They will never acknowledge themselves defeated,
which will be a great scandal. If the council
decrees that the pope is above the council (which
is the truth), the heretics will hold another, and
will elect an anti-pope (Luther, perhaps). Sire, the
remedy which you propose will give rise to greater
evils than those which we have now to cure.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_353" id="Ref_353" href="#Foot_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>The papacy in the sixteenth century had fallen into
a state of inertia. It was active enough as a political
power; but as a spiritual power it was nothing. It
had great pretensions still, as far as appearances went;
but it was satisfied if certain preferences and a certain
pomp were conceded to it. It was afraid of
everything that possessed any vitality, and feared not
only those it called heretics, but even an assembly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
consisting of prelates of the Roman Church. And
while the papacy was thus affected with a general
weakness as regards spiritual powers, the Reformation
was full of vigour and of life. It was a young warrior
attacking a decrepid veteran. Besides these general
causes, there were private motives which added to
Clement's inactivity; but these he kept to himself.
When he was alone in his chamber, he called to mind
that his birth was not legitimate; that the means he
had used to obtain the popedom had not been irreproachable;
and that he had often employed the resources
of the Church for his own interest ... in
waging a costly war, for instance. All this might be
brought against him in a council, and endanger his
position. But as his position was dearer to him than
the unity of the Church, he would grant nothing, and
so reduced Charles to despair by his evasions.</p>

<p>The hatred which the emperor bore to the pope
was still further increased by the pontiff's resistance.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_354" id="Ref_354" href="#Foot_354">[354]</a></span>
In his anger he appealed to the cardinals.
At first he succeeded, having brought powerful
inducements into play, and a consistory decided in
favour of the immediate convocation of a council.
The alarmed Clement set to work to bring back the
misguided cardinals, and he was successful; for a
second consistory, held on the 20th of December,
coincided with the pope. 'We cannot think of assembling
a council,' said the sacred college, 'before we
have reconciled all the christian princes.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_355" id="Ref_355" href="#Foot_355">[355]</a></span>
The emperor openly expressed his dissatisfaction. Wait
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
until Henry VIII., Francis I., and Charles V. are
agreed ... as well put it off to the Greek calends!
Clement endeavoured to pacify him. He would
assemble it at <i>a suitable time</i>, he said; and then, as he
feared that the Germans, on hearing of his refusal,
would hold a <i>national</i> council, he sent off envoys to
prevent it, at the same time hinting to the emperor
that they were empowered to prepare that nation
for a general council.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_356" id="Ref_356" href="#Foot_356">[356]</a></span>
 Was Charles V. the pope's
dupe? It is a doubtful point. Clement, an enthusiastic
disciple of his fellow-countryman Machiavelli,
was, conformably to the instructions of his master,
supple and false, without conscience and without
faith. But the emperor knew full well that such
were the precepts of the illustrious Florentine.</p>

<p class="side">=ITALIAN LEAGUE.=</p>

<p>For some time past Charles had been silently
meditating another project which, he thought, could
not fail to render him master of Italy. It was the
formation of a defensive Italian league against Francis.
He communicated his plan to the pope with the
reserve and ability that characterised him, and set
himself up as the defender of Rome. Clement, however,
did not believe in his generosity, but on the contrary
feared that this confederation would give him a
master; nevertheless he appeared to be charmed with
it. 'Yes!' he exclaimed, 'Italy must set itself against
the ambition of France.' At the same time he informed
the ambassador of Venice that he had said these things,
not as being his own opinion, but the emperor's.
'Report this prudently to your lords,' he added.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_357" id="Ref_357" href="#Foot_357">[357]</a></span>
The pontiff had always two faces and two meanings.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span></p>

<p>In reality, he did not know what course to pursue.
At one time he was ready to throw himself
into Charles's arms and run the same chances with
him; and then, on learning what had taken place at
Boulogne and Calais, he trembled lest the King of
France should throw off his obedience. These two
terrible monarchs made a shuttlecock of the pope,
and drove him to despair. But he remembered how
Machiavelli had said, that the world is governed by
two things—force and cunning; and leaving the former
to the emperor, he took refuge in the latter. 'Accordingly
Clement determined to move softly,' says Du
Bellay, 'temporising, quibbling, waiting, and stopping
to see what the French cardinals would bring him.'
They arrived just at this critical moment. It was
an ill-omened embassy for France, since no event of
the sixteenth century did more to strengthen the
dominion of intrigue, cowardice, debauchery, crime,
and persecution in that country.</p>

<p class="side">=THE FRENCH ENVOYS AND CLEMENT.=</p>

<p>Cardinal de Tournon, the most influential of the two
ambassadors, was a skilful priest, devoted to the pope
and popery, cruel, the accomplice of the Guises in
after years, and all his life one of the greatest enemies
of religious liberty. His colleague, Cardinal de Gramont,
Bishop of Tarbes and afterwards Archbishop of
Toulouse, was a more pliable diplomatist, and had
been employed in England at the time of the dissolution
of Henry's marriage with Catherine of Arragon.
The first of these two men was the more hierarchical,
the second the more politic; but both had the interests
of their master Francis at heart. Their mission was
difficult, and they had many a consultation about
what was to be done. Tournon was ready to sacrifice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
everything, truth in the first place, in order to
unite the king with the pope. 'It is to be feared,' he
said to his colleague, 'that if we let the holy father
know all the discontent of the two kings, we shall but
increase his despair; and that the emperor, profiting
by our threats, will gain him over and do with him
as he likes, which would lead to the disturbance of
christendom.' Instead of carrying out the Calais
resolutions, Tournon and Gramont determined to put
them aside. They thought that Francis I. was going
wrong, and desired to be more royalist than the king
himself. To win the pope from Charles V. and give
him to Francis I. was the great work they resolved to
attempt at Bologna. The emperor was there, and he
was a stout antagonist; but the two priests were not
deficient in skill. To save catholicism threatened in
France, and to lay the kingdom at the pope's feet, was
their aim. 'Let us carry out our instructions,' they
said, 'by beginning with the last article. Instead of
employing severity first and mildness last, we will do
just the contrary.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_358" id="Ref_358" href="#Foot_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>The two cardinals having been received by the
pontiff, paid him every mark of respect, and tried
to make him understand that, for the good of the holy
see, he ought to preserve the goodwill of the most
christian king. They therefore proposed an interview
with Francis, and even with the King of England,
that prince being eager to put an end to the difficulties
of the divorce. 'Finally,' they added, laying a
slight stress upon the word, 'certain proposals, formerly
put forward in the king's name, might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
carried out.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_359" id="Ref_359" href="#Foot_359">[359]</a></span>
—'These proposals,' says Du Bellay,
'would lead, it must be understood, to the great
exaltation of the pope and his family.' The last
argument was the decisive stroke which gained
Clement VII.</p>

<p>Francis, even while desiring to throw off the Roman
tutelage, wished to gain the support of the pope
in order to humiliate Charles V. He had therefore
revived a strange idea, which he had once already
hinted at, without overcoming, however, the excessive
repugnance which it caused him. But he saw
that the moment was critical, and that, to ally himself
with both Henry and Clement, he must make some
great sacrifice. He had therefore sent a special ambassador
to Bologna, to carry out a scheme which
would fill all Europe with surprise: a deplorable
combination which by uniting the pope, indissolubly
as it appeared, to the interests of the Valois, was sooner
or later to separate France from England, change the
channel that divides them into a deep gulf, infuse
Florentine blood into the blood of France, introduce
the vilest Machiavellism into the hearts of her kings
who boasted of their chivalrous spirit, check the
spread of learning, turn back on their hinges the gates
that were beginning to open to the sun, confine the
people in darkness, and install an era of debauchery,
persecution, and assassination both private and public.</p>

<p>The special ambassador charged with the execution
of this scheme was John, Duke of Albany, qualified
by his illustrious birth for transacting the great
affair. Alexander Stuart, son of James II., King of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
Scotland, having been exiled by his eldest brother
James III., had gone to France in 1485. His son
John, the last Duke of Albany, attached himself to
Louis XII., and followed him into Italy. Being
recalled to Scotland, he was made regent of the kingdom
in 1516, and again quitted his country to follow
Francis I. into Lombardy. This royal personage, supported
by Gramont and Tournon, was commissioned
by the King of France to propose to the pope the
marriage of his son Henry, Duke of Orleans, with
a girl of fourteen, a relative of the popes, and who
was named Catherine de Medici.</p>

<p class="side">=CATHERINE DE MEDICI.=</p>

<p>Catherine was the daughter of Lorenzo II. de
Medici, nephew of Leo X., and invested by his uncle
in 1516 with the duchy of Urbino. Lorenzo, who
had made himself hateful by his despotism, died the
very year of his daughter's birth (1519). The duchy
reverted to Leo X., and subsequently to its former
masters the Della Rovera, and Catherine was left a
portionless orphan. A marriage with this girl, descended
from the rich merchants of Florence, was a
strange alliance for the son of a king, and it was this
that made Francis hesitate; but the desire of winning
the pope's favour from his rival helped him at last to
overcome his haughty disgust. Clement, who held
(says Du Bellay) his family 'in singular esteem,' was
transported with delight at the offer. A Medici on
the throne of France!... He could not contain himself
for joy. At the same time Francis intended to
make a good bargain. He asked through the Duke
of Albany, whose wife was Catherine's maternal aunt,
that the pope should secure to his son Henry a fine
Italian state composed of Parma, Florence, Pisa,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
Leghorn, Modena, Urbino, and Reggio; besides (said
the secret articles) the duchy of Milan and the lordship
of Genoa, which, added the French diplomatists,
'already belong to the future husband.' In order to
fulfil these engagements the pope was to employ his
influence, his negotiations, his money, and his soldiers.
Clement said that the conditions were very reasonable.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_360" id="Ref_360" href="#Foot_360">[360]</a></span>
He knew perfectly well that he could not give
these countries to his niece; but that was the least of
his cares. The preceding year, when he was speaking
to Charles's ambassador of the claims of Francis upon
Italy, the Austrian diplomatist had said abruptly:
'The emperor will never <i>yield</i> either Milan or Genoa
to the King of France.'—'Impossible, no doubt!'
answered the pope, 'but could not they be <i>promised</i>
to him?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_361" id="Ref_361" href="#Foot_361">[361]</a></span>
... The scion of the Medici brought to
France neither Genoa nor Milan, nor Parma, nor
Piacenza, nor Pisa, but in their stead she gave it the
imbecile Francis II., the sanguinary Charles IX., the
abominable Henry III., the infamous Duke of Anjou,
and also that woman, at once so witty and dissolute,
who became the wife of Henry IV., and in comparison
with whom Messalina appears almost chaste. Four
children of the Medici are among the monsters recorded
in history, and they have been the disgrace and the
misery of France.</p>

<p class="side">=PROPOSALS OF MARRIAGE.=</p>

<p>The pope stalked proudly and haughtily through the
halls of his palace, and gave everybody a most gracious
reception. This good-luck, he thought, had come from
heaven. Not only did it cover all his family with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
glory, but secured to him France and her king, whose
reforming caprices began to make him uneasy; 'and
then,' adds Du Bellay, 'he was very pleased at finding
this loophole, to excuse himself to the emperor, who
was pressing him so strongly to enter into the Italian
league.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_362" id="Ref_362" href="#Foot_362">[362]</a></span>
Nevertheless the pope stood in awe of
Charles V., who seemed eager to set himself up for
a second Constantine, and he appeared anxious and
embarrassed.</p>

<p>Charles, whom nothing escaped, immediately remarked
this, and thought to himself that some new
wind had blown upon the pontiff. In order to find it
out, he employed all the sagacity with which he was
so eminently endowed. 'The emperor knew from the
language and countenance of the holy father,' says Du
Bellay, 'that he was less friendly towards him than
before, and suspected whence the change proceeded.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_363" id="Ref_363" href="#Foot_363">[363]</a></span>
Charles had heard something about this marriage
some time before; but the ridiculous story had only
amused him. The King of France unite himself with
the merchants of Florence!... And Clement can
believe this!... 'Hence Charles V., thinking,' as
Du Bellay tells us, 'that the affair would never be
carried out, had advised the pope to consent.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_364" id="Ref_364" href="#Foot_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=HENRY'S OPINION OF THE MARRIAGE.=</p>

<p>Meanwhile Francis lost no time. He had commissioned
Du Bellay, the diplomatist, to communicate
his intentions to his good brother the King of England,
who had a claim to this information, as he was godfather
to the future Henry II.—worthy godfather, and
worthy godson! The self-conceit of the Tudor was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
still more hurt than that of the Valois. He said
to Lord Rochford, whom he despatched to the King
of France: 'You will tell the Most Christian King,
our very dear brother, the great pleasure that we
enjoy every day by calling to mind the pure, earnest,
and kind friendship he feels for us.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_365" id="Ref_365" href="#Foot_365">[365]</a></span>
He added:
'Since our good brother has asked us, we are willing
to declare, that truly (as we know how he himself
considers it), having regard to the low estate and
family from which the pope's niece is sprung, and to
the most noble and most illustrious blood, ancestry,
and royal house of France, from which descends our
very dear and very beloved cousin and godson, the
Duke of Orleans, the said marriage would be very ill-matched
and unequal; and for this reason we are by
no means of opinion that it ought to be concluded.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_366" id="Ref_366" href="#Foot_366">[366]</a></span>
At the same time, after Henry had given his advice as
a sovereign, he could not fail to consult his personal
interests; and Rochford (Anne Boleyn's father) was
to say to the King of France: 'If, however, by this
means our brother should receive some great advantage,
which should redound to the profit and honour
both of himself and us; if the pope should do or concede
anything to counterbalance and make up for the
default of noble birth ... let him be pleased to inform
us of it; he will find us very prompt to execute whatever
shall be thought advisable, convenient, and opportune
by him and us.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_367" id="Ref_367" href="#Foot_367">[367]</a></span>
Henry, therefore, consented
that Francis should deal with the pope about his godson:
he only wished that he might be sold dear. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
full restoration to the favour of the court of Rome
after his marriage with Anne Boleyn was the price
that he asked. And then the royal godfather, who
was at heart the most papistical of kings, would have
declared himself fully satisfied and the pope's most
humble servant.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">INTRIGUES OF CHARLES V., FRANCIS I., AND CLEMENT VII.,
                             AROUND CATHERINE.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Winter 1532-1533.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the emperor was informed of these matters,
he began to knit his brows. A flash of light
revealed to him the ingenious plans of his rival, and
he took immediate steps to prevent the dangerous
union. Charles V., Francis I., Henry VIII., and the
pope were all in commotion at the thought of this
marriage, and little Catherine was the Briseis around
whom met and contended the greatest powers of the
world.</p>

<p class="side">=DOUBTS INSINUATED BY CHARLES.=</p>

<p>At first the emperor endeavoured to instil into the
pope's mind suspicions of the good faith of the King of
France. That was no difficult matter. 'Clement
dared not feel confident,' says Du Bellay, 'that the
king really wished to do him such great honour.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_368" id="Ref_368" href="#Foot_368">[368]</a></span>
—'The
Orleans marriage would certainly be very
honourable and advantageous,' said Charles V. and
his ministers; 'but his holiness must not rely upon
it; the king makes the proposal only with the intention
of <i>befooling</i> him and using him to his own benefit.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_369" id="Ref_369" href="#Foot_369">[369]</a></span>
And when the pope repeated the promises of Albany,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
Gramont, and Tournon, the ministers of Charles kept
silence, and replied only by a slight smile. The blow
had told. Clement, who always tried to deceive, was
naturally inclined to believe that the king was doing
the same.</p>

<p>When the emperor and the diplomatists saw that
they had made a breach, they attempted a new assault.
Charles asked the young lady's hand for Francis Sforza,
Duke of Milan. This scheme was worthy of that
exuberant genius which Charles always displayed
in the invention of means calculated to secure the
success of his policy. This union would, in fact, have
the double advantage of wresting Catherine and the
Milanese from France at one blow. Charles hinted to
her uncle that he would do much better to accept for
his young relative a <i>real</i> marriage than to run after a
shadow. 'It is a great offer, and the match is a good
one,' said Clement; 'but the other is so grand and
so honourable for my house, regard being had to dignities,
that I never could have hoped for such honour ...
and so much progress has been made, that I cannot
listen to any other proposal without offending the
king.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_370" id="Ref_370" href="#Foot_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>Clement had become hard to please. If the Medici
were the descendants of a merchant, the Sforzas came
from a peasant, a leader of free troops, a <i>condottiere</i>.
Clement looked down upon the Duke of Milan. 'Besides,'
says Guiccardini, 'he burnt with desire to marry
his niece to the second son of Francis I.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_371" id="Ref_371" href="#Foot_371">[371]</a></span>
This is
what he always came back to. Charles told him that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
Francis wanted, by this offer, to break up the Italian
league, and when that was done, the marriage would
be broken off too.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_372" id="Ref_372" href="#Foot_372">[372]</a></span>
But Clement maintained that the
king was sincere in his offer. 'Good!' said the emperor
to the pope; 'there is a very simple means of satisfying
yourself on that point. Ask the two cardinals
to procure immediately from France the powers necessary
for settling the marriage contract. You
will soon see whether his proposal is anything better
than base money which they want to palm off upon
you.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_373" id="Ref_373" href="#Foot_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>The emperor's remarks were not without their effect
upon Clement: he was thoughtful and uneasy. The
French ambassadors had been lavish of words, but
there was nothing written: <i>verba volant</i>. The pope
caught at the idea suggested by Charles. If the full
powers do not arrive, the king's treachery is unveiled;
if they arrive, the game is won. Clement asked for
them. 'Nothing is more easy,' said Tournon and
Gramont, who wrote to their master without delay.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_374" id="Ref_374" href="#Foot_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE KING'S HESITATION.=</p>

<p>Francis I. was startled when he received their
despatch. His proposal was sincere, for he thought it
necessary to his policy; but the remarks of Charles V.
and Henry VIII. about the daughter of the Florentine
merchant, and the astonishment of Europe,
which unanimously protested against 'such great disparity
of degree and condition,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_375" id="Ref_375" href="#Foot_375">[375]</a></span>
had sunk into his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
mind. He, so proud of his blood and of his crown
... countenance a misalliance! He hesitated; he
would only proceed slowly ... step by step ...
and with a long interval after each.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_376" id="Ref_376" href="#Foot_376">[376]</a></span>
If Charles,
who was impatient to return to Spain, should
leave Italy without banding it against France ...
then ... new facts, new counsel ... he would consider.
But now he was driven to the wall: the question
must be answered. Shall Catherine de Medici
come and sit on the steps of the throne of St. Louis,
or shall she remain in Italy? Shall she continue to
receive abominable lessons from her relative Alexander
de Medici, a detestable prince who exiled and
imprisoned even the members of his own family, and
confiscated their property, and was addicted to the
most scandalous debauchery? ... or shall she come
to France to put in practice those lessons among the
people of her adoption? The king must make up his
mind: the courier was waiting. One thing decided
him. His old gaoler, the emperor, said that this
marriage proposal was a trick. If Francis refused
what the pope asked, Charles would triumph, and
turn against him both pope and Italy. The king's
ambition was stronger than his vanity, and coming to
a desperate resolution, he had the full powers drawn
up, signed, and sent off.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_377" id="Ref_377" href="#Foot_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>They arrived at Bologna about the middle of
February. Albany, Gramont, and Tournon carried
them in triumph to the pope, who immediately communicated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
them to the emperor. The latter read the
procuration, which contained 'an express clause for
settling the marriage of the Duke of Orleans with the
Duchess of Urbino,' and was greatly surprised.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_378" id="Ref_378" href="#Foot_378">[378]</a></span>
'You see,' said Clement, 'there is no hole by which he can
creep out.' Charles could not believe it. 'The king
has only sent this document for a <i>show</i>,' he said to
Clement; 'if you press the ambassadors to go on and
conclude the treaty, they will not listen to you.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_379" id="Ref_379" href="#Foot_379">[379]</a></span>
A little while ago there had been nothing but words,
and now there was only a piece of <i>paper</i>.... The new
propositions were communicated to the duke and the
two cardinals, who replied: 'We offer to stipulate
forthwith the clauses, conditions, and settlements that
are to be included in the contract.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_380" id="Ref_380" href="#Foot_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE EMPEROR'S NEW MANŒUVRES.=</p>

<p>Clement breathed again, and believed in the star of
the Medici. If that star had placed his ancestors the
Florentine merchants at the head of their people, it
might well raise Catherine, the niece of two popes, the
daughter and grand-daughter of dukes, to the throne
of France. He informed the emperor that everything
was arranged, and that the terms of the contract were
being drawn up. Clement's face beamed with joy.
The emperor began to think the matter serious, 'and
was astonished and vexed above all,' says Du Bellay,
'at the frustration of his plan, which was to excite the
holy father against the king.' Charles saw that the
impetuosity of Francis had been too much for his
own slowness; but he knew how to retrace his steps,
and the fecundity of his genius suggested a last means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
of breaking up 'this detestable cabal.'—'Since it is
so,' he said, 'I require your holiness at least to include
among the conditions of the contract now drawing up,
the four articles agreed to between us, the first time
you spoke to me of this marriage.' Clement appeared
surprised, and asked what articles they were. 'You
promised me,' said Charles, 'first that the king should
bind himself to alter nothing in Italy; second, to confirm
the treaties of Cambray and Madrid; third, to
consent to a council; and fourth, to get the King of
England to promise to make no innovations in his
country until the matter of his divorce was settled at
Rome.' The King of France would never agree to
such conditions; the pope was dismayed. Would he
be wrecked just as he had reached the harbour?—'I
made no such promises,' he exclaimed eagerly. 'The
holy father,' says Du Bellay, 'formally denied ever
having heard of these matters.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_381" id="Ref_381" href="#Foot_381">[381]</a></span>
The altercation
between the two chiefs of christendom threatened to
be violent. Which of them was the liar? Probably
the pope had said something of the kind, but only for
form's sake, in order to pacify Charles, and without
any intention of keeping his promise. He was the
first to recover his calmness; he detested the emperor,
but he humoured him. 'You well know, Sire,' he
said, 'that the profit and honour accorded by the king
to my family in accepting my alliance, are so great,
that it belongs to him and not to me to propose conditions.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_382" id="Ref_382" href="#Foot_382">[382]</a></span>
He offered, however, to undertake that
everything should remain in 'complete peace.' The
emperor, a master in dissimulation, tried to conceal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
his vexation, but without success; this unlucky
marriage baffled all his plans. Francis had been more
cunning than himself.... Who would have thought
it? The King of France had sacrificed the honour of
his house, but he had conquered his rival. Confounded,
annoyed, and dejected, Charles paced up and
down with his long gloomy face, when an unexpected
circumstance revived his hopes of completely embroiling
the pope and the King of France.</p>

<p>We have witnessed the conferences that took place
between Clement and Charles on the subject of a
general council. The emperor had asked for one in
order 'to bring back the heretics to union with the
holy faith, and he observed that if it were not called,
it was to be feared that the heretics would unite with
the Turks; that they would fancy themselves authorised
to lay hands upon the property of the Church,
and would succeed in living in that liberty which
they called <i>evangelical</i>, but which,' added Charles,
'is rather <i>Mahometan</i>, and would cause the ruin of
christendom.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_383" id="Ref_383" href="#Foot_383">[383]</a></span>
The pope, who thought much more
of himself and of his family than of the Church,
had rejected this demand. He had smiled at seeing
the great potentate's zeal for the religious and evangelical
question.... Clement never troubled himself
about the Gospel: Machiavelli was the gospel of the
Medici. They cherished it, and meditated on it day
and night; they knew it by heart, and put it into
admirable practice. Clement and Catherine were its
most devoted followers and most illustrious heroes.</p>

<p class="side">=A LAY COUNCIL PROPOSED.=</p>

<p>The policy of the King of France was quite as interested,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
but it was more frank and honest. Even
while politically uniting with the pope, he did not
mean to place himself ecclesiastically under his guardianship.
He had, like Henry VIII., the intention of
emancipating kings from the pontifical supremacy,
and desired to make the secular instead of the papal
element predominate in christian society. For many
centuries the hierarchical power had held the first
rank in Europe: it was time that it gave way to the
political power. Francis, having come to a knowledge
of the opposite opinions of the pope and the emperor
touching the council, slipped between the two and
enunciated a third, which filled the emperor with
astonishment and the pontiff with alarm. It was one
of the greatest, most original, and boldest conceptions
of modern times: we recognise in it the genius of
Du Bellay and the aspirations of a new era. 'It is
true, as the holy father affirms,' said the King of
France, 'that the assembling of a council has its
dangers. On the other hand, the reasons of the
emperor for convoking it are most worthy of consideration;
for the affairs of religion are reduced to
such a pass that, without a council, they will fall into
inextricable confusion, and the consequence will be
great evils and prejudice to the holy father and all
christian princes. The pope is right, yet the emperor
is not wrong; but here is a way of gratifying their
wishes, and at the same time preventing all the
dangers that threaten us.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_384" id="Ref_384" href="#Foot_384">[384]</a></span>
Let all the christian
potentates, whatever be their particular doctrine (the
King of England and the protestant princes of Germany
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
and the other evangelical states, were therefore
included), first communicate with one another on the
subject, and then let each of them send to Rome as
soon as possible ambassadors provided with ample
powers to discuss and draw up by common accord all
the points to be considered by the council. They
shall have full liberty to bring forward anything
that they imagine will be for the unity, welfare, and
repose of christendom, the service of God, the suppression
of vice, the extirpation of heresy, and the
uniformity of our faith. No mention shall be made
of the remonstrances of our holy father, or of the
decisions of former councils; which would give many
sovereigns an opportunity or an excuse for not attending.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_385" id="Ref_385" href="#Foot_385">[385]</a></span>
When the articles are thus drawn up by
the representatives of the various states of christendom,
each ambassador will take a duplicate of them
to his court, and all will go to the council, at the
time and place appointed by them, well instructed
in what they will have to say. If those who have
separated from the Roman Church agree with the
others, they will in this way take the path of salvation.
If they do not agree, at least they will not be
able to deny that they have been deaf to reason, and
refused the council which they had called for so
loudly.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_386" id="Ref_386" href="#Foot_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>This is one of the most remarkable documents that
we have met with in relation to the intercourse between
France and Rome, and it has not attracted sufficient
attention. In it Francis makes an immense stride.
Convinced that the new times ought to tread in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
new path, he inaugurates a great revolution. He
emancipates the political power, so far as regards
religious matters, and desires that it shall take precedence
of the pontifical power in everything. If
his idea had been carried out, great ecclesiastical
questions would no longer have been decided in the
Vatican, but in the cabinets of princes. This system,
indeed, is not the true one, and yet a great step
had been taken in the path of progress. A new
principle was about to influence the destinies of the
Church.</p>

<p>Up to this time the clerical element had reigned
in it alone; but now the lay element claimed its place.
The new society was unwilling that priests alone
should govern christians, just as shepherds lead their
flocks. But this system, we repeat, was not the true
one. Christian questions ought not to be decided
either by pope or prince, but by the ministers of the
Church and its members, as of old in Jerusalem by
the <i>apostles</i>, <i>elders</i>, and <i>brethren</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_387" id="Ref_387" href="#Foot_387">[387]</a></span>
For this we have
the authority of God's Word. That evangelical path
is forbidden to the Roman-catholic Church; for it is
afraid of every christian assembly where the opinions
of believers are taken into account, and finds itself
miserably condemned to oscillate perpetually between
the two great powers—the pope and the king.</p>

<p class="side">=THE LAY COUNCIL REJECTED.=</p>

<p>It was very near the end of February when the emperor
received at Bologna this singular opinion of
the French king. Having failed in his attempts to
prevent the Orleans marriage, he was busy forming
the Italian league, and preparing to leave for Spain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
Charles instinctively felt the encroachment of modern
times in this project of Du Bellay's. To deprive the
pope and clergy of their exclusive and absolute
authority would lead (he thought) to taking it away
from kings also. It seemed to him that popery rendered
liberty impossible not only in the Church but
also among the people. Francis, or rather Du Bellay,
had imagined that Charles would say (as one of his
successors said<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_388" id="Ref_388" href="#Foot_388">[388]</a></span>
): 'My trade is to be a king,' and
that he would grasp at the institution of a <i>diplomatic</i>
papacy. But whether Charles wished to profit by
this opportunity 'to fish up again' the pope who had
plunged into French waters, or simply yielded to his
Spanish catholic nature and the desire he felt for unlimited
power, he rejected Francis's proposal. 'What!'
he exclaimed, 'shall the ambassadors of christian
kings and potentates lay down beforehand the points
to be discussed in the council?... That would be
depriving it of its authority by a single stroke. Whatever
is to be discussed in the council ought to depend
entirely on the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and not
on the appetites of men.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_389" id="Ref_389" href="#Foot_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=SECULARISATION OF THE POPEDOM.=</p>

<p>This answer vexed Francis considerably. His proposition
failing, it became a weapon in the hands of
his rival to destroy him. He therefore sought to
justify himself. 'I cannot help being surprised,' he
said, 'that, with a view to calumniate me, my opinion
has been misrepresented to the emperor. Is it not
more reasonable to have this business managed by ambassadors
who can arrive speedily in Rome, than to
wait for a council which at the soonest cannot meet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
within a year?... And as for everything depending
upon the Holy Ghost, assuredly my proposal has been
wickedly and malignantly interpreted; for as we
shall send ambassadors guided by a sincere affection
for the Church, is it not evident that this assembly
cannot be without the Holy Ghost?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_390" id="Ref_390" href="#Foot_390">[390]</a></span>
Thus the king,
in defending himself, took shelter under the <i>inspiration</i>
of his diplomatists. We may well admit that the
Holy Ghost was less with the pope than with the king;
but He was really with neither of them.</p>

<p>Thus for a moment the idea of Francis I. fell to the
ground; it was premature, and only began to be realised
in after days by the force of circumstances and in the
order of time. It was in 1562, when the council
which had been so much discussed, and which opened
at Trent in 1545, met for the third time, that this new
fashion was introduced into Roman catholicism. The
prelates could not come to an understanding, the
Italian deputies wishing to maintain everything, while
the French and German deputies demanded important
concessions with a view to a reconciliation between the
princes and their subjects. There were struggles, jests,
and quarrels: they came to blows in the streets. The
majority of the council were angry because the Roman
legates regularly delayed to give their opinions until
the courier arrived from Rome. 'Their Inspiration,'
said the French, who were always fond of a joke, 'their
Inspiration comes to Trent in a portmanteau.' The
meeting was about to be broken up, when the papacy,
being obliged to choose between two evils, resolved to
come to an understanding with the princes. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
pope agreed that all important questions should be
previously discussed in the secular courts, and the
secondary questions be left to the council, provided
that all proper respect was shown to the papacy.
Rome triumphed within the walls of Trent, but she
ceased to be a pure hierarchy. From that hour the political
element has had the precedence, and the papacy
has become more and more dependent on the secular
power. The scheme of Francis I. has been partly
realised. There remains, however, one step more
to be taken. Instead of the interested decisions of
kings, it is the sovereign and unchangeable Word of
God which ought to be placed on the throne of
the Church.</p>

<p>Charles V. hoped that the singular opinion of the
King of France would incline Clement to enter into
the Italian league; but the pope was not very susceptible
in religious matters. Still, as the emperor was
impatient, Clement resolved to give him this trifling
satisfaction. Why should he refuse to enter into a
league whose object was to exclude Francis I. from
Italy? As at that very time he was signing secret
articles by which he bound himself to give to France
Parma, Piacenza, Urbino, Reggio, Leghorn, Pisa,
Modena, and even Milan and Genoa, there was no
reason why the worthy uncle of Catherine should not
sign another treaty with Charles which stipulated
exactly the contrary. Francis would not be alarmed
at the pontiff's entering the league; he would understand
that it was simply an honorary proceeding, a
diplomatic measure. The marriage of the pope's
niece caused the poor emperor so much annoyance,
that he deserved at least this consolation. Besides,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
when the pope gave his signature to Charles V., he
was doing (as he thought) a very honest thing, for
he had not the least intention of keeping the solemn
promises he had made to Francis.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_391" id="Ref_391" href="#Foot_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>It was now the 28th of February, and the imperial
equipage was ready: horses, mules, carriages, servants,
officers, noblemen, were all waiting the moment of
departure. The ships that were to convey the mighty
Charles and his court to Spain were in the harbour of
Genoa, ready to weigh anchor. This very day had
been fixed for signing the act of the Italian league.
The high and mighty contracting powers met in the
palace of Bologna. The document was read aloud
before the delegates of the princes and sovereigns of
Italy included in it. Every one assented, the signatures
were affixed, and Clement eagerly added his name,
promising himself to sign another contract very shortly
with the King of France.</p>

<p class="side">=CARDINALS' HATS ASKED AND GIVEN.=</p>

<p>Everything seemed as if it would pass off in a
regular way, without Charles allowing his vexation to
break out. That prince, who knew so well how to
restrain himself, raised a sensation, however, among
the great personages around him. Addressing the
pope, he demanded a cardinal's hat for three of his
prelates: it was a trifling compliment (he thought)
which Clement might well concede him; but the pope
granted one hat only. The ambassador of France
then came forward, and, on behalf of his master, demanded
one for John, Bishop of Orleans and uncle of
the Duke of Longueville, which was granted. Then
the same ambassador, growing bolder, begged, <i>on</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
<i>behalf of the King of England</i>, a cardinal's hat for the
Bishop of Winchester. This was too much for Charles.
'What! ask a favour for a king who has put away my
aunt Catherine, who is quarrelling with the pope and
rushing into schism!'... 'The emperor took this
request,' says Du Bellay, 'in very bad part.'—'We
can see clearly,' said Charles to those around him,
'that the affairs of these two kings are in the same
scales; that one does not less for the other than for
himself.' Then, throwing off his usual reserve, he
openly expressed his disapprobation. 'This request
of a hat for England,' said he, 'displeases me more
than if the ambassador of France had asked <i>four</i> for
his master.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_392" id="Ref_392" href="#Foot_392">[392]</a></span>
The diplomatists there present could
not turn away their eyes from that face, usually so
placid, and now so suddenly animated; they were
secretly delighted at seeing any feeling whatever,
especially one of ill-humour, on the features of that
powerful monarch, all whose words and actions were
the result of cold reflection and calculated with the
nicest art. But no one was so rejoiced as Hawkins,
the English ambassador: 'The emperor departed from
hence evil-contented,' he wrote to Henry forthwith,
'and satisfied in nothing that he came for. All he did
was to renew an old league, lest he should be seen to
have done nothing.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_393" id="Ref_393" href="#Foot_393">[393]</a></span>
Charles was eager to leave the
city where he had been duped by the pope and checkmated
by the king, and already he repented having
shown his displeasure. He descended the steps of the
palace, threw himself into his carriage, and departed
for Milan, where he had some business to settle before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
going to Genoa and Spain. It was, as we have said,
Friday, the 28th of February.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_394" id="Ref_394" href="#Foot_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=MEETING OF FRANCIS AND CLEMENT.=</p>

<p>The pope remained ten days longer at Bologna.
There was a talk of an interview between him and the
King of France, to whom he had written with his own
hand. The papal nuncio had proposed to the king that
the emperor should be present also. 'Provided the
King of England be the fourth,' answered Francis.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_395" id="Ref_395" href="#Foot_395">[395]</a></span>
'We should be unwilling, the King of England and I,'
added he, 'to be present at the interview except with
forces equal to those of the emperor, for fear of a surprise....
Now it might happen that, the escorts of these
<i>not very friendly</i> princes being together, we should
begin a war instead of ratifying a peace.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_396" id="Ref_396" href="#Foot_396">[396]</a></span>
They accordingly
fell back upon the conference of <i>two</i>, pending
which the marriage should be completed. Nice was at
first selected as the place of meeting; but the Duke
of Savoy, who did not like to see the French at Nice,
objected. 'Well, then,' said the pope, 'I will go to
Antibes, to Fréjus, to Toulon, to Marseilles.' To ally
himself with the family of France, he would have gone
beyond the columns of Hercules. Francis, on his side,
desired that the pope, who had waited for the emperor
in Italy, should come and seek him in his own kingdom.
The pope thus showed him greater honour than
he had shown Charles—on which point he was very
sensitive. Marseilles was agreed upon.</p>

<p>At last all was in proper train. The blood of the
Valois and of the Medici was about to be united. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
clauses, conditions, and conventions were all arranged.
The marriage ceremony was to be magnificently
celebrated in the city of the Phocæans. The pope
was at the summit of happiness, and the bride's eyes
sparkled with delight. The die was cast; Catherine
de Medici would one day sit on the throne of France;
the St. Bartholomew was in store for that noble
country, the blood of martyrs would flow in torrents
down the streets of Paris, and the rivers would roll
through the provinces long and speechless trains of
corpses, whose ghastly silence would cry aloud to
heaven.</p>

<p>But that epoch was still remote; and just now Paris
presented a very different spectacle. It is time to
return thither.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">STORM AGAINST THE QUEEN OF NAVARRE AND HER 'MIRROR
                             OF THE SINFUL SOUL.'<br />
 (<span class="smc">Summer 1533.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="side">=UNEASINESS OF THE ULTRAMONTANES.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Romish party would not be comforted under
its defeat. Beda, Le Picard, and Mathurin in
exile; evangelical sermons freely preached in the great
churches of the capital; the new doctrines carried
through Paris from house to house; and the Queen of
Navarre seated, as it were, upon the throne during
her brother's absence, protecting and directing this
Lutheran activity—it was too much! The anxiety
and alarm of the ultramontanists increased every day:
they held numerous conferences; and if the young
Alsatian whom we saw at the gate of the Sorbonne,
or any other inquisitive person, could have crept into
these catholic committees, he would have heard the
most violent addresses. 'It is not only the approach
of the enemy that alarms us,' they said: 'he is there
... the revolutionary, immoral, impious, atheistic,
abominable, execrable monster!' Other epithets were
added, to be found only in the popish vocabulary.
'He is making rapid progress; unless we resist him
vigorously, it is all over! The world will perhaps
see crumbling under his blows those ancient walls of
Roman catholicism under which the nations have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
taken shelter for so many ages.' And hence the
Sorbonne was of the same opinion with the priests
and the most hot-headed laymen, that, overlooking
for the moment secondary persons, it was necessary
to strike the most dangerous. In their eyes the
Queen of Navarre was the great enemy of the papacy;
the monks, in particular, whose disorders she had
not feared to expose, were full of fury against
her; their clamours were heard in every quarter.
'The queen,' they said, 'is the modern Eve by
whom the new revolt is entering into the world.'—'It
is the nature of women to be deceived,' said one;
and to prove it he quoted St. Jerome. 'Woman is the
gate of the devil,' said another, citing the authority of
Tertullian. 'The wily serpent,' said the greatest
doctors, 'remembers that memorable duel fought in
Paradise. Another fight is beginning, and he is again
putting in practice the stratagems that succeeded so
well before. At the beginning of the world and now,
it is always against woman—that tottering wall, that
<i>pannel</i> so weak and easy to break down—that he
draws up his battery. It is the Queen of Navarre
who supports the disciples of Luther in France; she
has placed them in schools; she alone watches over
them with wonderful care, and saves them from all
danger.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_397" id="Ref_397" href="#Foot_397">[397]</a></span>
Either the king must punish her, or she
must publicly recant her errors.' The ultramontanists
did not restrict themselves to words: they entered into
a diabolical plot to ruin that pious princess.</p>

<p class="side">=PLOTS AGAINST MARGARET.=</p>

<p>This was not an easy thing to do. The king loved
her, all good men revered her, and all Europe admired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
her. Yet, as Francis was very jealous of his authority,
the priests hoped to take advantage of his extreme susceptibility
and set him at variance with a sister who
dared to have an opinion of her own. Besides, the
Queen of Navarre, like every other eminent person,
had powerful enemies at court, 'people of Scythian
ingratitude,' who, having been received in her household
and raised by her to honours, secretly did all
in their power to bring her into discredit with the king
and with her husband.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_398" id="Ref_398" href="#Foot_398">[398]</a></span>
The most dangerous enemy
of all was the grand-master Montmorency, an enterprising,
brave, and imperious man, skilful in advancing
his own fortune, though unlucky with that of the kingdom;
he was besides coarse and uncultivated, despising
letters, detesting the Reformation, irritated by the
proselytism of the Queen of Navarre, and full of contempt
for her books. He had great influence over
Francis. The Sorbonne thought that if the grand-master
declared against her, it would be impossible
for Margaret to retain the king's favour.</p>

<p>An opportunity occurred for beginning the attack,
and the Sorbonne caught at it. The Queen of Navarre,
sighing after the time when a pure and spiritual religion
would displace the barren ceremonial of popery,
had published, in 1531, a christian poem entitled:
<i>The Mirror of the Sinful Soul, in which she discovers
her Faults and Sins, as also the Grace and Blessings
bestowed on her by Jesus Christ her Spouse</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_399" id="Ref_399" href="#Foot_399">[399]</a></span>
Many persons had read this poem with interest, and admired
the queen's genius and piety. Finding that this edition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
published in a city which belonged to her, had made
no noise, aroused no persecution, and had even gained
her a few congratulations, she felt a desire to issue
her pious manifesto to a wider circle. Encouraged,
moreover, by the position which her brother had just
taken up, she made an arrangement with a bookseller
rather bolder than the rest, and in 1533 published
at Paris a new edition of her book, without the
author's name, and without the authorisation of the
Sorbonne.</p>

<p>The poem was mild, spiritual, inoffensive, like the
queen herself; but it was written by the king's sister,
and accordingly made a great sensation. In her verses
there were new voices, aspirations towards heaven
long unknown; many persons heard them, and here
and there certain manifestations showed themselves
of a meek and inward piety long since forgotten. The
alarmed Sorbonne shouted out—'heresy!' There
was, indeed, in the <i>Mirror</i> something more than aspirations.
It contained nothing, indeed, against the
saints or the Virgin, against the mass or popery, and
not a word of controversy; but the essential doctrine
of the Reformation was strongly impressed on it,
namely, salvation by Jesus Christ alone, and the certain
assurance of that redemption.</p>

<p class="side">=BEDA DISCOVERS HERESY IN THE POEMS.=</p>

<p>At the time of which we are writing, Beda had not
been banished. At the beginning of 1533 he had
been intrusted by the Sorbonne with the examination
of all new books. The fiery syndic discovered the
<i>Mirror</i>, and with excess of joy he fell upon it to seek
matter of accusation against the king's sister. He
devoured it; he had never been so charmed by any
reading, for at last he had proof that the Queen of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
Navarre was really a heretic.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_400" id="Ref_400" href="#Foot_400">[400]</a></span>
'But understand me
well,' he said; 'they are not dumb proofs nor half
proofs, but literal, clear, complete proofs.' Beda prepared
therefore to attack Margaret. What a contrast
between the formal religion of the Church and that of
this spiritual poem! St. Thomas and the other chiefs
of the schools teach that man may at least possess
merits of <i>congruity</i>; that he may perform supererogatory
works, that he must confess his sins in the ear of
the priest, and satisfy the justice of God by acts of
penance, <i>satisfactio operis</i>. But according to the
<i>Mirror</i>, religion is a much simpler thing ... all is
summed up in these two terms: man's sin and God's
grace. According to the queen, what man needs is to
have his sins remitted and wholly pardoned in consequence
of the Saviour's death; and when by faith he
has found assurance of this pardon, he enjoys peace....
He must consider all his past life as being no
longer for him a ground of condemnation before God:
these are the <i>glad tidings</i>. Now these <i>tidings</i> scandalised
Beda and his friends exceedingly. 'What!' he
exclaimed, holding the famous book open before them,
'what! no more auricular confessions, indulgences,
penance, and works of charity!... The cause of
pardon is the reconciliatory work of Christ, and what
helps us to make it our own is not the Church, but
faith!' The syndic determined to make the 'frightful'
book known to all the venerable company.</p>

<p>The Sorbonne assembled, and Beda, holding the
heretical poem in his hand, read the most flagrant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
passages to his colleagues. 'Listen,' he said, and the
attentive doctors kept their eyes fixed on the syndic.
Beda read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">Jesus, true fisher thou of souls!</div>
<div class="verse indent2">My only Saviour, only advocate!</div>

<div class="verse">My Spouse bears all my sins, though great they be,</div>
<div class="verse">And all his merits places upon me....</div>
<div class="verse">Come, Saviour, make thy mercies known....</div>
<div class="verse">Jesus for me was crucified:</div>

                   href="#Foot_401">[401]</a></span></div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>It has been said that Margaret's poems are theology
in rhyme. It is true that her verses are not so elegant
as those of our age, and that their spirit is more
theological than the poetry of our days; but the
theology is not that of the schools, it is that of the
heart. What specially irritated the Sorbonne was the
peace and assurance that Margaret enjoyed, precious
privilege of a redeemed soul, which scholasticism had
condemned beforehand. The queen, leaning upon the
Saviour, seemed to have no more fear. 'Listen again,'
said Beda:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Satan, where is now thy tower?</div>
<div class="verse">Sin, all withered is thy power.</div>
<div class="verse">Pain or death no more I fear,</div>
<div class="verse">While Jesus Christ is with me here.</div>
<div class="verse">Of myself no strength have I,</div>
<div class="verse">But God, my shield, is ever nigh.<span
                   class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_402" id="Ref_402"

</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="side">=ASSURANCE OF SALVATION.=</p>

<p>Thus, argued the doctors of the Sorbonne, the queen
imagines that sins are remitted gratuitously, no satisfaction
being required of sinners. 'Observe the foolish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
assurance,' said the syndic, 'into which the new
doctrine may bring souls. This is what we find in

<p>This simple faith, supported by the promises of God,
scandalised the doctors. 'No one,' said they, 'can
promise himself anything certain as regards his own
salvation, unless he has learnt it by a special revelation
from God.' The council of Trent made this declaration
an article of faith. 'The queen,' continued her accuser,
'speaks as if she longed for nothing but heaven:</p>

</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Some one having observed that the Queen of Navarre
had not appended her name to the title of her work,
her accuser replied: 'Wait until the end, the signature
is there;' and then he read the last line:</p>

  <p class="center">The good that he has done to me, his Margaret.<span
  class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_405" id="Ref_405"
  href="#Foot_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>In a short time insinuations and accusations against
the sister of the king were heard from every pulpit.
Here a monk made his hearers shudder as he described
Margaret's wicked <i>heresies</i>; and there another tried to
make them laugh. 'These things,' says Theodore
Beza, 'irritated the Sorbonne extremely, and especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
Beda and those of his temper, and they could not
refrain from attacking the Queen of Navarre in their
sermons.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_406" id="Ref_406" href="#Foot_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>Other circumstances excited the anger of the monks.
Margaret did not love them. Monachism was one of
the institutions which the reformers wished to see disappear
from the Church, and the Queen of Navarre, in
spite of her conservative character, did not desire to
preserve it. The numerous abuses of the monastic
life, the constraint with which its vows were often accompanied,
the mechanical vocation of most of the conventuals,
their idleness and sensuality, their practice
of mendicancy as a trade, their extravagant pretensions
to merit eternal life and to atone for their sins by
their discipline, their proud conviction that they had
attained a piety which went beyond the exigencies of
the divine law, the discredit which the monastic institution
cast upon the institutions appointed by God, on
marriage, family, labour, and the state politic; finally,
the bodily observances and macerations set above that
living charity which proceeds from faith, and above
the fruits of the Spirit of God in man:—all these
things were, according to the reformers, entirely
opposed to the doctrine of the Gospel.</p>

<p class="side">=THE QUEEN OF NAVARRE'S TALES.=</p>

<p>Margaret went further still. She had not spared the
monks, but on the contrary had scourged them soundly.
If Erasmus and Ulrich von Hutten had overwhelmed
them with ridicule, the Queen of Navarre had in
several tales depicted their grovelling character and
dissolute life. She had, indeed, as yet communicated
these stories to few besides her brother and mother,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>
and never intended publishing them; but, some
copies having been circulated among the attendants
of the court, a few leaves had fallen into the hands
of the monks, and this was the cause of their anger.
Margaret, like many others of her time, was mistaken—such
at least is our opinion—as to the manner in
which the vices of the monasteries ought to be combated.
Following the example of Menot, the most
famous preacher of the middle ages, she had described
faithfully, unaffectedly, and sometimes too broadly
the avarice, debauchery, pride, and other vices of the
convents. She had done better than this, however; to
the silly nonsense and indecent discourses of the grey
friars she had opposed the simple, severe, and spiritual
teaching of the Gospel. 'They are moral tales,'
says a contemporary author (who is not over favourable
to Margaret); 'they often <i>degenerate</i> into real
sermons, so that each story is in truth only the <i>preface
to a homily</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_407" id="Ref_407" href="#Foot_407">[407]</a></span>
After a narrative in illustration of
human frailty, Margaret begins her application thus:
'Know that the first step man takes in confidence in
himself, by so much he diverges from confidence in
God.' After describing a false miracle by which an
incestuous monk had tried to deceive Margaret's
father, the Count of Angoulême, she added: 'His faith
was proof against these external miracles. We have
but one Saviour who, by saying <i>consummatum est</i> (it
is finished), showed that we must wait for no successor
to work out our salvation.' No one but the monks
thought, in the sixteenth century, of being scandalised
by these tales. There was then a freedom of language
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
which is impossible in our times; and everybody felt
that if the queen faithfully painted the disorders of the
monks and other classes of society, she was equally
faithful in describing the strict morality of her own
principles and the living purity of her faith. It was
her daughter, the austere Jeanne d'Albret, who published
the first correct edition of these <i>Novels</i>; and
certainly she would not have done so, if such a publication
had been likely to injure her mother's memory.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_408" id="Ref_408" href="#Foot_408">[408]</a></span>
But times have changed; the book, harmless then, is so
no longer; in our days the tales will be read and the sermons
passed over: the youth of our generation would
only derive harm from them. We acquit the author as
regards her intentions, but we condemn her work. And
(apologising to the friends of letters who will accuse
us of barbarism) if we had to decide on the fate of
this book, we would willingly see it experience a fate
similar to that which is spoken of in the Bible, where
we are told that <i>many Corinthians brought their books
together and burned them</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_409" id="Ref_409" href="#Foot_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE MIRROR SEIZED BY THE SORBONNE.=</p>

<p>Let us return to the <i>Mirror</i>, in which the pious soul
of Margaret is reflected.</p>

<p>The Faculty decided that the first thing to be done
was to search every bookseller's shop in the city and
seize all the copies found there.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_410" id="Ref_410" href="#Foot_410">[410]</a></span>
Here Beda disappeared:
he no longer played the principal part. It
is probable that the proceedings against him had
already begun; but this persecution, by removing its
leader, helped to increase the anger of the Romish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
party, and consequently the efforts of the Sorbonne
to ruin the Queen of Navarre. As Beda was absent,
the priest Le Clerq was ordered to make the search.
Accompanied by the university beadles, he went to
every bookseller's shop, seized the <i>Mirror of the Sinful
Soul</i>, wherever the tradesman had not put it out
of sight, and returned to the Sorbonne laden with his
spoils. After this the Faculty deliberated upon the
measures to be taken against the author.</p>

<p>This was no easy matter: they knew that the king, so
hasty and violent, had much esteem and affection for
his sister. The most prudent members of the Faculty
hesitated. Their hesitation exasperated the monks,
and the rage with which the more fanatical were
seized extended even to the provinces. A meeting
of the religious orders was held at Issoudun in Berry
to discuss what ought to be done. The superior of
the grey friars, an impetuous, rash, and hardly sane
person, spoke louder than all the rest. 'Let us have
less ceremony,' he exclaimed; 'put the Queen of
Navarre in a sack and throw her into the river.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_411" id="Ref_411" href="#Foot_411">[411]</a></span>
This speech, which circulated over France, having
been reported to the Sorbonne doctors, alarmed them,
and many counselled a less violent persecution, to
which a Dominican friar answered: 'Do not be
afraid; we shall not be alone in attacking this heretical
princess, for the grand-master is her mortal
enemy.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_412" id="Ref_412" href="#Foot_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>Montmorency, who next to Francis was now the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
most important personage in the kingdom, concealed
under the cloak of religion a cruel heart and peevish
disposition, and was feared by everybody, even by his
friends. If he were gained over, the Queen of Navarre,
attacked simultaneously by the priestly and
the political party, must necessarily fall.</p>

<p>Margaret supported these insults with admirable
mildness. At this very time she was carrying on an
almost daily correspondence with Montmorency, and
subscribed all her letters: '<i>Your good aunt and friend</i>.'
Full of confidence in this perfidious man, she called
on him to defend her. 'Dear nephew,' she wrote, 'I beg
you to believe that, as I am just now away from the
king, it is necessary for you to help me in this matter.
<i>I rely upon you</i>; and in this trust, which I am sure
can never fail me, confides your good aunt and friend,
Margaret.' The queen made some allusion to the
violent language of the monks, but with great good-humour.
'I have desired the bearer,' she said, 'to
speak to you about <i>certain nonsense</i> that a Jacobin
monk has uttered in the faculty of theology.' This
was all: she did not make use of one bitter word.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_413" id="Ref_413" href="#Foot_413">[413]</a></span>
Montmorency, that imperious courtier who before
long persecuted the protestants without mercy, began
to think himself strong enough to ruin Margaret, and
we shall soon see what was the result of his perfidious
insinuations. The Sorbonne deliberated as to what
was to be done. According to the decrees of Sixtus
IV. and Alexander VI., no books, treatises, or writings
whatsoever<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_414" id="Ref_414" href="#Foot_414">[414]</a></span>
could be printed without an express
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
authorisation; but the Queen of Navarre had printed
her book without any such permission. The society,
without pretending to know the author, declared the
<i>Mirror of the Sinful Soul</i> prohibited, and put it in the
<i>Index Librorum Prohibitorum</i>.</p>

<p class="side">=THE PRIESTS' COMEDY.=</p>

<p>This was not enough. The priests excited the
students; but while the former were playing a tragedy,
the latter (or rather their teachers) resorted to
satire. The scholars of the college of Navarre, who
passed from the grammar to the logic class, were
in the habit of giving a dramatic representation on the
1st of October. The clerical heads of the college,
wishing to render the queen hateful to the people and
ridiculous to the court, composed a drama. The
parts were distributed among the pupils; the rehearsals
began, and those who were admitted to them
agreed that the author had so seasoned the plot with
gall and vinegar, that success was certain.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_415" id="Ref_415" href="#Foot_415">[415]</a></span>
The report
spread through the Latin quarter: and even
Calvin heard of it, for he kept himself well informed
of all that took place in the schools. While applying
himself constantly to the work of God, he kept watch
also upon the work of the adversary. There was so
much talk about this play, that, when the day of the
representation arrived, there was a rush for admission,
and the hall was crammed. The monks and theologians
took their seats in front, and the curtain rose.</p>

<p>A queen, magnificently dressed and sitting calmly
on the stage, was spinning, and seemed to be thinking
of nothing but her wheel. 'It is the king's sister,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
said the spectators; 'and she would do well to keep
to her distaff.'</p>

<p>Next a strange character appeared: it was a woman
dressed in white, carrying a torch and looking fiercely
around her. Everybody recognised the fury Megæra.
'That is Master Gerard,' they said, 'the almoner of
the king's sister.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_416" id="Ref_416" href="#Foot_416">[416]</a></span>
Megæra, advancing cautiously,
drew near the queen with the intention of withdrawing
her from her peaceful feminine occupation, and
making her lay aside her distaff. She did not show
her enmity openly, but came slily forward, putting on
a smiling look, as if bringing additional light. She
walked round and round the queen, and endeavoured
to divert her attention by placing the torch boldly
before her eyes.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_417" id="Ref_417" href="#Foot_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>At first the princess takes no heed, but continues
spinning; at length, alas! she stops and permits
herself to be attracted by the false light
before her; she gives way, she quits her wheel....
Megæra has conquered, and in exchange for the
distaff she places the Gospel in the queen's hand.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_418" id="Ref_418" href="#Foot_418">[418]</a></span>
The effect is magical; in a moment the queen is
transformed. She was meek, she becomes cruel; she
forgets her former virtuous habits; she rises, and,
glaring around with savage eyes, takes up a pen
to write out her sanguinary orders, and personally
inflicts cruel tortures on her wretched victims. Scenes
still more outrageous than these follow. The sensation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
was universal! 'Such are the fruits of the Gospel!'
said some of the spectators. 'It entices men away
to novelties and folly; it robs the king of the devoted
affection of his subjects, and devastates both Church
and State.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_419" id="Ref_419" href="#Foot_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=SUCCESS OF THE COMEDY.=</p>

<p>At last the play was ended. The Sorbonne exulted;
the Queen of Navarre, who had formerly lashed the
priests and monks, was now scourged by them in
return.</p>

<p>Shouts of approbation rose from every bench, and
the theologians clapped the piece with all their might;
such applause as that of these reverend doctors had
never been heard before.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_420" id="Ref_420" href="#Foot_420">[420]</a></span>
There were, however, a few
reasonable men to whom such a satire written against
the king's sister appeared unbecoming. 'The authors
have used neither veil nor figure of speech,' they
said: 'the queen is openly and disgracefully insulted
in the play.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_421" id="Ref_421" href="#Foot_421">[421]</a></span>
The monks, finding they had gone
too far, wished to hush up the matter; but in a short
time the whole city was full of it, and a few days
after a mischievous friend went and spoke of it at
court, describing the whole play, scene after scene, to
the queen herself.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_422" id="Ref_422" href="#Foot_422">[422]</a></span></p>

<p>The Sorbonne, the highest authority in the Church
after the pope, had struck the first blow; the second
had been given in the colleges; the third was to be
aimed at Margaret by the court. By ruining this
princess in the eyes of her brother, the enemies of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
the Reformation would cause her the most unutterable
sorrow, for she almost adored Francis. Afterwards
they would get her banished to the mountains
of Béarn. Montmorency lent himself to this intrigue;
he advanced prudently, speaking to the king about
heresy, of the dangers it was bringing upon France,
and of the obligation to free the kingdom from it for
the salvation of souls. Then, appearing to hesitate,
he added: 'It is true, Sire, that if you wish to extirpate
the heretics, you must begin with the Queen of
Navarre.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_423" id="Ref_423" href="#Foot_423">[423]</a></span>
... And here he stopped.</p>

<p>Margaret was not informed of this perfidious proceeding
immediately; but everybody told her that if
she allowed the impertinence of the monks and the
condemnation of the Sorbonne to pass unpunished, she
would encourage their malice. She communicated
what had taken place to her brother, declared herself
to be the author of the <i>Mirror</i>, and insisted on the
fact that it contained nothing but pious sentiments,
and did not attack the doctrines of the Church:
'None of us,' she said, 'have been found <i>sacramentarians</i>.'
Finally, she demanded that the condemnation
by the theological faculty should be rescinded,
and the college of Navarre called to account.</p>

<p class="side">=CHRISTIANS MADE A SHOW.=</p>

<p>Calvin watched the whole business very closely;
it might almost be said, after reading his letter, that
he had been among the spectators. He censured the
behaviour of both scholars and masters.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_424" id="Ref_424" href="#Foot_424">[424]</a></span>
'Christians,'
he said later, 'are made a show of, as when in
a triumph the poor prisoners are paraded through the
city before being taken to prison and strangled. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
the spectacle made of believers is no hindrance to
their happiness, for in the presence of God they
remain in possession of glory, and the Spirit of God
gives them a witness who dwells steadfast in their
hearts.'<span

 <h3>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">TRIUMPH OF THE QUEEN OF NAVARRE.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Autumn 1533.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">FRANCIS was not at Paris when the storm broke
out against his sister. In the summer of 1533,
says the chronicle, 'the king visited his states and
lordships of Languedoc, and made his triumphal
entry into the city of Toulouse.'<span

It was by letter,
therefore, that he heard of what was taking place.
All were asking what he would do. On the one hand,
he had a great affection for the queen; but, on the
other, he did not like his tranquillity to be disturbed;
he protected learning, but he detested the Gospel.
His better self gained the upper hand; his hatred of
the absurdities of the monks was aroused; his great
susceptibility made him take the affronts offered to
his sister as if they had been offered to himself; and
one after another he gave Margaret's enemies a forcible
lesson.</p>

<p>The first whom he taught his place was Montmorency.
When the latter endeavoured to instil his
perfidious insinuations into the king's mind, Francis
silenced him: 'Not a word more about it,' he said:
'she is too fond of me to take up with any religion that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span>
will injure my kingdom.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_427" id="Ref_427" href="#Foot_427">[427]</a></span>
Margaret was informed
subsequently of the attempt of the grand-master,
'whom she never liked more,' adds Brantôme.</p>

<p class="side">=THE FRANCISCAN FRIAR.=</p>

<p>The second to feel the king's hand was the prior
of the Franciscans who had proposed to sew Margaret
in a sack and throw her into the Seine. 'Let
him suffer the punishment he desired to inflict upon
the queen,' he exclaimed. On hearing of this sentence
the monks became irritated, and the populace,
according to one historian, got up a riot. But the
queen interceded for the wretch, and his life was
spared; he was simply deprived of his ecclesiastical
dignities and sent to the galleys for two years.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_428" id="Ref_428" href="#Foot_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>The play represented against the queen, as well as
the priests who had composed it and superintended
the representation, next engaged the king's attention;
he resolved not to spare them, and at the least to put
them in a terrible fright. He issued his orders, and
immediately the lieutenant of police marched out and
appeared at the head of a hundred archers before the
college of Navarre.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_429" id="Ref_429" href="#Foot_429">[429]</a></span>
'Surround the building,' he
said, 'so that no one can escape.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_430" id="Ref_430" href="#Foot_430">[430]</a></span>
The archers did
as they were ordered. For this narrative we are
again indebted to Calvin, who continued to take the
deepest interest in the whole affair. The orders of
the lieutenant were not executed without noise, and
some of the professors and pupils, attracted to the
windows, had watched the movements of the municipal
officers. The author of the drama, who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
expected nothing like this, and who was very vain and
continually boasting of his pious exploit, happened to
be in the room of a friend, joking about the queen
and the famous comedy, when suddenly he heard an
unusual noise.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_431" id="Ref_431" href="#Foot_431">[431]</a></span>
He looked out, and, seeing the college
surrounded by soldiers, became alarmed and
confused. 'Hide me somewhere,' he exclaimed. He
was put in a place where it was supposed nobody
could find him: there are always good hiding-places
in colleges. 'Stay there,' said his friends, 'until we
find an opportunity for your escape.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_432" id="Ref_432" href="#Foot_432">[432]</a></span>
And then
the door was carefully shut.</p>

<p class="side">=ARRESTS IN THE COLLEGE OF NAVARRE.=</p>

<p>Meanwhile the lieutenant of police had entered
with a few of his archers, and demanded the surrender
of the author of the satire against the Queen of
Navarre. The head of the college, a man of distinction,
profound learning, and great influence, whom
Calvin styles 'the great Master Lauret,' and Sturm
'the king of the wise,' did not deserve his name. He
refused everything. Upon this, the sergeants began
to search the building for the culprit; and professors
and students were in great anxiety. But every nook
and corner was explored in vain; they found nothing.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_433" id="Ref_433" href="#Foot_433">[433]</a></span>
The lieutenant thereupon ordered his archers to lay
hands upon the actors in default of the author, and
he himself arrested one of the persons who had taken
a part in the play. This was the signal for a great
tumult. Master Lauret, knowing himself to be more
guilty than those youths, rushed upon the lieutenant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
and endeavoured to rescue the scholar;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_434" id="Ref_434" href="#Foot_434">[434]</a></span>
the students,
finding themselves supported by their chief, fell upon
the archers, and kicked and beat them, some even
pelting them with stones.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_435" id="Ref_435" href="#Foot_435">[435]</a></span>
There was a regular battle
in the college of Navarre. But the law prevailed at
last, and all the beardless actors fell into the hands of
the police.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was bent on knowing the nature of
their offence. 'Now,' said he to the juvenile players,
'you will repeat before me what you said on the
stage.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_436" id="Ref_436" href="#Foot_436">[436]</a></span>
The unlucky youths were forced to obey;
in great confusion and hanging their heads, they repeated
all their impertinence. 'I have not done,' resumed
the lieutenant, turning to the head of the
college; 'since the author of the crime is concealed
from me, I must look to those who should have prevented
such insolence. Master Lauret, you will go
with me as well as these young scamps. As for you,
Master Morin (he was the second officer of the college),
you will keep your room.' He then departed
with his archers; Lauret was taken to the house of a
commissary, and the students were sent to prison.</p>

<p>The most important affair still remained—the decision
come to by the Sorbonne against Margaret's
poem. The king, wishing to employ gentle means,
simply ordered the rector to ask the faculty if they
had really placed the <i>Mirror</i> in the list of condemned
books,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_437" id="Ref_437" href="#Foot_437">[437]</a></span>
and in that case to be good enough to point
out what they saw to blame in it. To the rector,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
therefore, was confided the management of the affair.
A new rector had been elected a few days before
(10th of October); and whether the university perceived
in what direction the wind was blowing, or
wished to show its hostility to the enemies of the
light, or desired to court the king's favour by promoting
the son of one of his favourites, the chief
physician to the court, they had elected, in spite of
the faculty of theology, Nicholas Cop, a particular
friend of Calvin's. 'Wonderful!' said the friends of
the Gospel: 'the king and his sister, the rector of
the university, and even, as some say, the Bishop of
Paris, lean to the side of the Word of God; how can
France fail to be reformed?'</p>

<p>The new rector took the affair vigorously in hand.
Won over to the Gospel by Calvin, he had learnt, in
conversation with his friend, that sin is the great
disease, the loss of eternal life the great death, and
Jesus Christ the great physician. He was impatient
to meet the enemies of the Reform, and the king
gave him the desired opportunity.... He had several
conversations with Calvin on the subject, and convened
the four faculties on the 24th of October, 1532. The
Bishop of Senlis, the king's confessor, read his Majesty's
letter to them; after which the youthful rector, the
organ of the new times, began to speak, and, full of the
ardour which a recent conversion gives, he delivered
(Calvin tells us) a long and severe speech,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_438" id="Ref_438" href="#Foot_438">[438]</a></span>
a christian
philippic, confounding the conspirators who were plotting
against the Word of God. 'Licence is always
criminal,' he said; 'but what is it when those who
violate the laws are those whose duty it is to teach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span>
others to observe them?... Now what have they done?
They have attacked an excellent woman, who is alike
the patroness of sound learning and mother of every
virtue.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_439" id="Ref_439" href="#Foot_439">[439]</a></span>
They penetrate into the sanctuary of the
family of our kings, and encroach upon the sovereign
majesty... What presumptuous temerity, what imprudent
audacity!... The laws of propriety, the laws
of the realm, the laws of God even, have all been violated
by these impudent men... They are seditious
and rebellious subjects.' Then turning to the faculty
of theology, the rector continued: 'Put an end, Sirs,
to these foolish and arrogant manners; or else, if
you have not committed the offence, do not bear the
responsibility. Do you desire to encourage the malice
of those who, ever ready to perpetrate the most
criminal acts, wipe their mouths afterwards and say:
"It is not I who did it! it is the university!" while
the university knows nothing about it?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_440" id="Ref_440" href="#Foot_440">[440]</a></span>
Do not mix
yourselves up in a matter so full of danger, or ...
beware of the terrible anger of the king.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_441" id="Ref_441" href="#Foot_441">[441]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE SORBONNE DISAVOWS ITS ACT.=</p>

<p>This speech, the terror inspired by the king's name,
and the recollection of Beda's imprisonment, disturbed
the assembly. The theologians, who were all guilty,
basely abandoned their colleague, who had only carried
out a general resolution, and exclaimed unanimously:
'We must disavow the rash deed.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_442" id="Ref_442" href="#Foot_442">[442]</a></span>
The four faculties
declared they had not authorised the act of which the
king complained, and the whole responsibility fell on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
Le Clerq, curé of St. André, who had taken the most
active part in the matter. He was the Jonah to be
thrown into the sea.</p>

<p>Le Clerq was very indignant. He had gone up and
down the city in the sight of everybody, he had ransacked
the booksellers' shops to lay hold of the heretical
<i>Mirror</i>; the booksellers, if necessary, could depose
against him; but when he found himself abandoned by
those who had urged him on, he was filled with anger
and contempt. Still, he endeavoured to escape the
danger that threatened him, and seeing among the
audience several officers of the court, he said in French,
so that all might understand him: 'In what words,
Sirs, can I sufficiently extol the king's justice?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_443" id="Ref_443" href="#Foot_443">[443]</a></span>
Who can describe with what unshaken fidelity this great
prince has on all occasions shown himself the valiant
defender of the faith?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_444" id="Ref_444" href="#Foot_444">[444]</a></span>
I know that misguided men<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_445" id="Ref_445" href="#Foot_445">[445]</a></span>
are endeavouring to pervert the king's mind, and conspiring
the ruin of this holy faculty; but I have a firm
conviction that their manœuvres will fail against his
majesty's heroic firmness. I am proud of the resistance
I make them. And yet I have done nothing of
myself; I was delegated by an order of the university
for the duty I have fulfilled.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_446" id="Ref_446" href="#Foot_446">[446]</a></span>
And do you imagine
that in discharging it, I had any desire to get up a plot
against an august princess whose morals are so holy,
whose religion is so pure,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_447" id="Ref_447" href="#Foot_447">[447]</a></span>
as she proved not long ago
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
by the respect with which she paid the last honours to
her illustrious mother? I consider such obscene productions
as <i>Pantagruel</i> ought to be prohibited; but I
place the <i>Mirror</i> simply among the suspected books,
because it was published without the approbation of the
faculty. If that is a crime, we are all guilty—you,
gentlemen,' he said, turning towards his colleagues,
'you as well as myself, although you disavow me.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_448" id="Ref_448" href="#Foot_448">[448]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE UNIVERSITY APOLOGISES.=</p>

<p>This speech, so embarrassing to the doctors of the
faculty, secured the triumph of the queen. 'Sirs,'
said the king's confessor, 'I have read the inculpated
volume, and there is really nothing to blot out of it,
unless I have forgotten all my theology.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_449" id="Ref_449" href="#Foot_449">[449]</a></span>
I call,
therefore, for a decree that shall fully satisfy her
majesty.' The rector now rose again and said: 'The
university neither recognises nor approves of the censure
passed upon this book. We will write to the
king, and pray him to accept the apology of the
university.' Thereupon the meeting broke up.</p>

<p>Thus did Margaret, the friend of the reformers,
come out victorious from this attack of the monks.
'This matter,' says Beza, 'somewhat cowed the fury
of our masters (<i>magistri</i>), and greatly strengthened
the small number of believers.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_450" id="Ref_450" href="#Foot_450">[450]</a></span>
The clear and striking
account which Calvin has left us, has enabled us
to watch the quarrel in all its phases. As we read
it, we cannot help regretting that the reformer did not
sometimes employ his noble talents in writing history.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_451" id="Ref_451" href="#Foot_451">[451]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></div>

<p>An astonishing change was taking place in France.
Calvin and Francis appeared to be almost walking
together. Calvin watched with an observing eye the
movements of men's minds, and his lofty understanding
delighted in tracing out the approaching consequences.
What did he see in the year 1533? The
different classes of society are in motion; men of the
world begin to speak more freely;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_452" id="Ref_452" href="#Foot_452">[452]</a></span>
students, with the
impetuosity of youth, are rushing towards the light;
many young professors perceive that Scripture is
above the pope; one of his most intimate friends is at
the head of the university; the fanatical doctors are in
exile; and the most influential men both in Church and
State are favourable to the Reform. The Bishop of
Senlis, confessor to the king; John du Bellay, Bishop
of Paris, who possesses the king's entire confidence;
his brother William, one of the greatest men in France,
seem all to be placing themselves at the service of
evangelical truth. William du Bellay, in particular,
excited the greatest hopes among the reformers at this
time; they entertained, indeed, exaggerated ideas
about him. As Berquin was no more, and Calvin
had hardly appeared, it was Du Bellay, in their opinion,
who would reform France. 'O that the Lord would
raise up many heroes like him!' said the pious Bucer;
'then should we see Christ's kingdom appearing with
the splendour of the sun.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_453" id="Ref_453" href="#Foot_453">[453]</a></span>
The Sire de Langey
(William du Bellay) is ready to suffer everything for
Jesus Christ.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_454" id="Ref_454" href="#Foot_454">[454]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></div>

<p class="side">=REFORM MOVEMENT IN FRANCE.=</p>

<p>The most earnest men believed in the salutary
influences which the Reformation would exert. In
fact, by awakening the conscience and reviving faith,
it was to be a principle of order and liberty; and
the religious activity which it called into existence
could not but be favourable to education and morality,
and even to agriculture, manufactures, and commerce.
If Francis I. had turned to the Gospel, the noblest
minds would have followed him, and France would
have enjoyed days of peace and marvellous prosperity.</p>

<p>Among the enlightened men of whom we are speaking,
we must include Philip de Chabot, seignior of
Brion, admiral of France, a favourite with the king,
and inclined to the cause of the Reform;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_455" id="Ref_455" href="#Foot_455">[455]</a></span>
Maure Musée, groom of the chamber, also won over to the
Gospel; and the pious Dame de Cany, who influenced
her sister, the Duchess of Etampes, in favour of the
reformed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_456" id="Ref_456" href="#Foot_456">[456]</a></span>
That frivolous woman was far from being
converted; but if the Reform was reproached with the
protection she afforded it, the evangelicals called to
mind that Marcia, mistress to the Emperor Commodus,
as the duchess was to the king, had protected the
early christians, and primitive Christianity was none
the less respected for it.</p>

<p>Calvin did not place his hope in the powers of the
world: 'Our wall of brass,' he said, 'is to have God
propitious to us. <i>If God be for us</i>—that is our only
support. There is no power under heaven or above
which can withstand his arm, and having him for
our defender we need fear no evil.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_457" id="Ref_457" href="#Foot_457">[457]</a></span>
And yet the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
blows which Francis I. had warded from the head of
the queen were to fall upon Cop and Calvin himself.
But before we come to these persecutions, we must
follow the king, who, quitting Toulouse and Montpellier,
proceeded to Marseilles to meet the pope.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS interview of the pope with the king might be
more injurious to the Gospel than all the attacks
of the Sorbonne. If Clement united sincerely with
Francis against Charles; if Catherine de Medici became
the pledge of union between Rome and France;
would not the Reformation soon be buried by the
mournful glare of the pale torches of this fatal marriage?
Yet men still hoped that the projected interview
would not take place. In fact, Henry VIII.
and the emperor did all they could to prevent Francis
from meeting the pope.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_458" id="Ref_458" href="#Foot_458">[458]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE INTENDED MARRIAGE.=</p>

<p>But Clement VII., more charmed than ever with
a matrimonial union between the family of the Florentine
merchants and that of St. Louis, cared naught for
the emperor or the king of England; and about the
end of April 1533, he convoked a sacred college at
Rome, to whom he communicated his plans. They
already knew something about them: the Roman cardinals
smiled and congratulated his Holiness, but the
Spanish cardinals looked very much out of humour.
The pope tried to persuade them that he only desired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>
this marriage for the glory of God and of the Church.
'It is for <i>holy opportunities</i>,' he told them. No one
dared oppose it openly; but, on leaving the meeting,
the emperor's cardinals hurried to his ministers and
informed them of the pontifical communication. The
latter lost no time; they called upon all their friends,
managed them with great ability, and, by dint of energy
and stratagem, succeeded in holding a congregation at
the beginning of June, at which none of the French
cardinals were present. Not daring to oppose the
marriage itself, Charles's prelates displayed extreme
sensibility for the honour and welfare of the pope.
They appeared to be suddenly seized with a violent
affection for Clement. 'What! the pope in France!'
they exclaimed. 'Truly it must be something more
than the marriage of a niece to <i>move a pope from his
seat</i>.' Then, as if Clement's health was very precious
to them, and the Roman air excellent, the crafty
Spaniards brought forward sanitary reasons. 'Such
a journey would be dangerous, <i>considering the extreme
heat of Provence</i>.'—'Never mind that,' cunningly
answered the pope; 'I shall not start until after the
first rains.'</p>

<p class="side">=IMPERIAL OBSTACLES.=</p>

<p>Charles then sought other means to prevent the
conference. He will contrive that the pope shall delay
his departure from week to week, until the winter sets
in, and then it is not to be thought of. A very natural
occasion for these delays presented itself. The marriage
of Henry VIII. with Anne Boleyn having been made
public, the emperor haughtily demanded that justice
should be done to the queen, his aunt. Here, certainly,
was matter enough to occupy the court of Rome for
months; but Clement, who had let the English business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
drag along for years, being eager to finish the <i>other</i>
marriage, hastily assembled a consistory, and pronounced
against Henry VIII. all the censures which
Charles V. demanded. Then, in his zeal forgetting
his usual cunning, he made Catherine's marriage the
peroration of his speech, and having done with England
and its king, he ended by saying: 'Gentlemen,
if any of you desire to make the voyage with me, you
must hold yourselves in readiness for departure.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_459" id="Ref_459" href="#Foot_459">[459]</a></span></p>

<p>Immediate preparations were made for fitting up
the galleys of Rhodes in which the pope was to sail.
All was bustle in the harbour. Those long low barks
were supplied with everything necessary for subsistence,
for sailing, and even for attack and defence.
The oars were fixed in their places; the yards and
sails were set; the flags were hoisted.... Then the
imperialists, trying to outwit the pope, had recourse to
a new stratagem; they were smitten with a sudden
fondness for Coron.—'Coron, that city in the south
of Greece,' they said to the pope, 'a city of such great
importance to christendom, is attacked by the Turks;
we require the galleys of Rhodes to defend it; we must
deliver the Greeks our brothers from slavery, and
restore the empire of the East.'... The pope understood;
it was difficult to beat him in cunning. 'Well,
well,' said he, 'make haste; fly to the help of christendom....
I will lend you the said galleys, and will add
my own ... and ... I will make the passage on board
the galleys of France.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_460" id="Ref_460" href="#Foot_460">[460]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the emperor turned to the Swiss; the Dukes of
Savoy and Milan, also, fearing that at the projected interview
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
something would be <i>brewed</i> to their detriment,
united with him. These three princes attempted to
induce the catholic cantons to enter the Italian league.
If these terrible Helvetic bands pass the Alps, all idea
of travelling will be abandoned by the pope. How
could he expose himself to pikes and arquebuses? Clement VII.
had not the warlike disposition of Julius II.
'The King of France favours the protestants,' said
Charles's deputies to the catholic cantons; 'he desires
to put the evangelical cantons in a condition to avenge
the defeat at Cappel; but if you join us, you have
nothing to fear.' At these words the catholics became
eager<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_461" id="Ref_461" href="#Foot_461">[461]</a></span>
to enter the league against the king and the
pope; but Francis sent them money to keep quiet, and
they did not move.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_462" id="Ref_462" href="#Foot_462">[462]</a></span></p>

<p>Were all his manœuvres to fail? Never had a marriage
been heard of against which so many obstacles
had been raised; but it was written in the book of
fate, said many; the arms forged against it could not
succeed; and the haughty Charles vainly agitated all
Europe—Swiss, Germans, Greeks, and Turks. His
ministers now had recourse to another stratagem.
Everybody knew that the pope was not brave. They
revived their tender affection for his person; and as
Switzerland was not to be tempted, they turned to
Africa. 'Let your Holiness beware,' they said; 'if
you undertake this voyage, you will certainly fall into
the hands of the Moors.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_463" id="Ref_463" href="#Foot_463">[463]</a></span>
... A fleet of pirates, lurking
behind the islands of Hyères, will suddenly appear,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
fall on the ship in which you are sailing, and carry
you off.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_464" id="Ref_464" href="#Foot_464">[464]</a></span>
This time the pope was staggered. The
terror inspired by the barbarian ships was at that time
very great. To be carried away by the Moors! A
pope captive in Algiers or Tunis! What a dreadful
thought!</p>

<p>Will he go or will he not? was the question
Europe set itself. But the matter was violently canvassed
at Rome, where Guelphs and Ghibelines almost
came to blows. Arguments for the marriage, and
consequently for the voyage, were not wanting. 'The
time has come,' said the papists, 'for a bold stroke to
prevent France from being lost like Germany and
England.' There were loud discussions in the convents
and churches, and even in the public places. A
Franciscan of the Low Countries, Herbom by name,
a monk of fiery fanaticism, stirred up the pontifical
city. 'Luther, Zwingle, and Œcolampadius,' he said,
'are soldiers of Pilate; they have crucified Jesus
Christ.... But, alas! alas! this crime is repeated
in our days ... at Paris. Yes, even at Paris, by
certain disciples of Erasmus.' It was clearly necessary
for the pope and his little niece to hasten to France,
in order to prevent what these blaspheming monks
dared to call the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="side">=THE POPE DETERMINES TO GO.=</p>

<p>At last Clement made up his mind. He would
brave the fury of the waves, and risk the attacks of
the corsairs, in order to conquer the <i>soldiers of Pilate</i>
and give a royal husband to his niece. The galleys
of France, commanded by the Duke of Albany, left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
Marseilles in September to fetch the pope, who had
gone to Pisa, making a boast, wherever he went, of the
most noble disinterestedness. 'I am going to this
interview,' he said, 'in order to procure the peace of
Europe, to prepare an expedition against the infidels,
to lead back the King of England to the right path,
and, in a word, solely for the interests of christendom.'
Then, after thus disguising himself, like the wolf in the
fable, under a borrowed dress, he showed the tip of
his ear, and begged the Duke of Albany to escort <i>their
common relative</i> to Nice, where she would wait for
further orders. The honour done to his family was
so great that doubts were continually arising in his
mind about the trustworthiness of the French king's
promises. He would not take his niece with him to
Marseilles, for fear he should have to bring her back.
He will see Francis alone first; he will speak to him
and sound him. Clement believed that his piercing
eye would read the king's heart to the very bottom.
When all his fears are removed, Catherine shall come
to France; but until then, she shall only go part of the
way.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_465" id="Ref_465" href="#Foot_465">[465]</a></span></p>

<p>The young lady departed for Nice, and people said,
pointing to her as they saw her going on board ship:
'There is the real cause of the strange journey of a
pope to France! If it were a matter touching the
safety of the Church, Clement would not do so much;
but it is to place a Medici beside a throne, and
perhaps set her upon it.'... The French fleet put to
sea: the ship, on whose mainmast the standard of
France had been hoisted, exhibited a sight at once gay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
and sad. Beneath the flags and banners, at the side
of the Duke of Albany, and in the midst of a brilliant
retinue, might be seen a kind of little fairy, who was
then making her first appearance in the world. She
was a young creature, of middle stature, with sparkling
eyes and bell-like voice, who appeared to possess
some supernatural power, and singularly fascinated
every one that came near her. Her enchantments
and her philtres were the subtle poison on which the
papacy relied for destroying heresy. This child,
between thirteen and fourteen years of age, skipped
with joy about the stately ship. 'I am going to be
the daughter-in-law of the glorious King of France,'
she said to herself. Death, with whom this strange
creature seemed to have made a secret and terrible
treaty, was in truth erelong to raise her to the summit
of power. The galleys of Albany, after having conveyed
<i>the girl</i> to Nice (it is Guicciardini's word),
returned to Leghorn, the port of Pisa, and on the 4th
of October the pope, with the cardinals and all his
household, put to sea.</p>

<p class="side">=PAPAL PLANS, FRENCH HOPES.=</p>

<p>The papal fleet, all fluttering with banners, had a
smooth passage.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_466" id="Ref_466" href="#Foot_466">[466]</a></span>
Clement could without interruption
meditate on a thousand different projects. Marry
Catherine to the son of the King of France; free himself,
thanks to the support of this prince, from the
patronage of the emperor whom he detested; put off
indefinitely the council which Charles had been so
bold as to promise to the protestants; and finally
crush the Reformation, both in France and elsewhere....
Such were Clement's projects during the voyage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
Before leaving Rome, he had drawn up (1st of September)
a bull against the heretics; he had it on board
the ship, and he purposed demanding its immediate
execution from Francis, as a wedding present. The
winds blew softly in the direction of Marseilles; all
congratulated themselves on the beauty of the passage;
but this fleet, in appearance so inoffensive, which
glided so smoothly over the waters of the Mediterranean,
carried, like the bark of Ulysses, stores of
future tempests.</p>

<p>Opinions were much divided in France about the
pope's voyage. If Clement satisfied Francis, the
Reform was ruined; if he thwarted the king, France
would follow the example of England. Everybody
admitted the hypothesis that pleased him best.
'Francis and Clement,' said the reformed, 'follow
such opposite courses, that it is impossible for them
to coincide.'—'The king and the pope,' said the ultramontanists,
'are about to be united by indissoluble
bonds, and popery will be restored in France in all
its exclusive supremacy.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_467" id="Ref_467" href="#Foot_467">[467]</a></span>
There were however some
of the school of Erasmus who remained in doubt. 'As
for me,' wrote Professor Sturm to Bucer, 'I desire
much that popery should be overthrown, but ... I
fear greatly that it will be restored.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_468" id="Ref_468" href="#Foot_468">[468]</a></span>
Sturm did
not compromise himself. To which side will Marseilles
make Francis I. incline? Historians have decided
that he was won over to Rome; but after hearing
the historians, we must listen to history.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE POPE AT MARSEILLES.=</p>

<p>At the beginning of October 1533, the ancient city
of the Phocæans was in a state of great excitement;
the King of France and the pope were coming; what
an honour! It is well known that the inhabitants of
that city are quick, enthusiastic, and fond of show
and parade. Watchmen had been placed on the
highest points to telegraph the approaching fleet. At
length, on the 4th of October, the castles of If and
Notre Dame de la Garde suddenly gave the looked-for
signals. One cry only was heard in the streets of
Marseilles: 'The flotilla with the pope on board has
come in sight.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_469" id="Ref_469" href="#Foot_469">[469]</a></span>
A feverish agitation pervaded the city;
the sound of trumpets, clarions, and hautboys filled
the air; the people hurried to the harbour. Nobles
and prelates went on board the ships that had been
kept ready; their sails were unfurled, and in a short
time this extemporised fleet saluted that of the pope
with deafening acclamations. Many devout catholics
trembled with joy and admiration; they could hardly
believe their eyes. 'Behold the real representative
of Christ,' they said, 'the father of all christians, the
only man who can at will give new laws to the
Church;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_470" id="Ref_470" href="#Foot_470">[470]</a></span>
the man who has never been mistaken and
never will be; whose name is alone in the world,
<i>vice-God</i> upon earth.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_471" id="Ref_471" href="#Foot_471">[471]</a></span>
Clement smiled: in Italy he
had never heard such exclamations or witnessed such
enthusiasm. O France! truly art thou the eldest
daughter of the Church! He did not know that
vanity, curiosity, love of pomp, and a fondness for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
noise had much to do with this rapture, and that
France, like her king Clovis, worships what it has
cast down, and casts down what it has worshipped.
The pope had no leisure to indulge in such reflections.
At the moment his galley entered the harbour, three
hundred pieces of artillery fired a salute. Notre Dame
de la Garde, the tower of St. John, the abbey of St.
Victor, the harbour and its vicinity were all on fire.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_472" id="Ref_472" href="#Foot_472">[472]</a></span></p>

<p>Francis was not to be seen among the vast and
brilliant crowd which filled Marseilles. There were
princes of the blood, prelates, diplomatists, magistrates,
courtiers, and warriors; but the king, although
at the gates of the city, kept himself in the background
and apart. However, when the night came,
and everybody had retired to their quarters to rest
after so fatiguing a day, a man, wrapped up in a
cloak, entered the city, glided mysteriously along the
dark streets, and stopped at the gate of the palace
where the pope was lodging. This man was immediately
introduced into the apartments where Clement
was preparing to take his repose: it was the King of
France.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_473" id="Ref_473" href="#Foot_473">[473]</a></span>
... What was the object of this nocturnal
visit? Was it because the king wished to sound the
pontiff in secret, before receiving him officially? Was
it the etiquette of the time? However that may be,
Francis, after a secret and confidential conversation,
returned with the same mystery, wearing a very
satisfied look. The pope had promised everything,
all the rights, all the possessions,—in a word, whatever
he had made up his mind not to give.</p>

<p>The next day the pope, dressed in his pontifical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
robes, and seated in a magnificent chair borne on
men's shoulders, made his solemn entry, attended by
his cardinals, also in all the brilliancy of their costume,
and by a great number of lords and ladies of
France and Italy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_474" id="Ref_474" href="#Foot_474">[474]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=LATIN ADDRESS TO THE POPE.=</p>

<p>Early in the morning, and while the streets were
echoing with cries of joy, the president of the parliament,
living in one of the handsomest houses of
Marseilles, was pacing his room with anxious brow, gesticulating
and carefully repeating some Latin phrases.
That magistrate had been commissioned, as a great
orator, to deliver an address to the pope; but as
unfortunately Latin was not familiar to him, he had
had his speech written out beforehand, and by dint
of labour he had so far committed it to memory,
as to be able to repeat it off-hand—provided there
was no change made in it.</p>

<p>At the same moment, a messenger from the pope
appeared at the king's levée with a paper, and requested,
on behalf of the pontiff, who had a great fear
of the terrible Charles V., that the said oration should
be delivered as it was written on the paper he brought
with him, so as to give the emperor no offence. Francis
despatched Clement's draft to the president. What
a disappointment! The new address was precisely
the contrary of what he had been learning by heart.
The famous orator became confused: he did not know
what to do.... Alas! he had but a few minutes to
spare, and the sonorous words which would have
offended the great emperor, and which he had counted
on reciting in his loudest voice, kept recurring to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
mind. He fancied himself in the presence of that
magnificent assembly of proud Roman prelates who
knew Latin so well.... There could be no doubt
about it ... he would become embarrassed, he would
stammer, he would not remember what he had to say,
and would break down. He was quite in a fever.
The president, no longer master of himself, hurried
off to the king, and begged him to give the office
to some one else. 'Very well, then,' said Francis to
Bishop du Bellay, 'you must undertake it.' At
that moment the procession started. It reached
its destination; the Bishop of Paris, although taken
unawares, put a bold face upon the matter; and being
a good Latin scholar and able orator, he executed his
commission wonderfully well.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_475" id="Ref_475" href="#Foot_475">[475]</a></span></p>

<p>The official conferences began shortly after, and
neither king nor pope spared protestations, stratagems,
or falsehoods: the pope particularly excelled in
the latter article. 'He used so much artifice in the
business,' says Guicciardini,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_476" id="Ref_476" href="#Foot_476">[476]</a></span>
'that the king confided
marvellously in him.' What Francis required to compensate
him for the misalliance was not much: he
asked for the duchies of Urbino and Milan, Pisa,
Leghorn, Reggio, Modena, Parma, Piacenza, and
Genoa. But if the king was inexhaustible in his
demands, the pope was equally so in his promises,
being the more liberal as he intended to give nothing.
Clement, touched by the good-nature of Francis, who
appeared to believe all that was told him, sent at last
to Nice for the youthful Catherine.</p>

<p class="side">=BULL AGAINST HERETICS.=</p>

<p>It was not decorous for the pope to appear to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
come so far only to give away a young lady. He
proposed, therefore, in order to conceal his intrigues,
to issue the bull against the heretics which he had
brought with him. It was his wedding present, and
nothing could better inaugurate Catherine's entry into
France. But the diplomatist, William du Bellay, did
all in his power to prevent this truly Roman transaction.
He had several very animated conversations on
this subject with the cardinals and with the pope himself.
He represented to him the necessity of satisfying
the protestants of Germany: 'A free council
and mutual concessions,' he said; but Clement was
deaf. Du Bellay would not give way; he struggled
manfully with the pontiff, and conjured him not to
attempt to put down the Reformation with violence.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_477" id="Ref_477" href="#Foot_477">[477]</a></span>
He used similar language to Francis, and laid before
him some letters which he had recently received from
Germany; but the king replied that he was taking the
matter too seriously. The bull of excommunication
was simply a <i>manner</i>, a papal form ... and nothing
more. The bull was published, and there was a great
noise about it. Francis and Clement, each believing
in the other's good faith, were deceiving one another.
The only truth in all this Marseilles business was the
gift the pope made to France of Catherine de Medici.
That was quite enough certainly.</p>

<p>As soon as the pope's niece arrived, preparations
were made for the marriage. The ministers of the king
and of the pope took the contract in hand, and the
latter having spoken of an annuity of one hundred
thousand crowns: 'It is very little for so noble an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
alliance,' said the treasurers of Francis I.—'True,'
replied Strozzi, one of Clement's most able servants;
'but observe that her grace the Duchess of Urbino
brings moreover three rings of inestimable value ...
Genoa, Milan, and Naples.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_478" id="Ref_478" href="#Foot_478">[478]</a></span>
These diamonds, whose
brilliancy was to dazzle the king and France, never
shone on Catherine's fingers or on the crown of
Henry II.</p>

<p class="side">=MARRIAGE OF CATHERINE AND HENRY.=</p>

<p>The ceremony was conducted with great magnificence.
The bride advanced, young, brilliant, radiant
with joy, with smiling lips and sparkling eyes, her
head adorned with gold, pearls, and flowers; and in
her train ... Death.... Death, who was always her
faithful follower, who served her even when she would
have averted his dart; who, by striking the dauphin,
was to make her the wife of the heir to the crown; by
striking her father-in-law, to make her queen; and
by striking down successively her husband and all
her sons, to render her supreme controller of the
destinies of France. In gratitude, therefore, towards
her mysterious and sinister ally, the Florentine woman
was forty years later, and in a night of August, to give
him a magnificent entertainment in the streets of Paris,
to fill a lake with blood that he might bathe therein,
and organise the most terrible festival that had ever
been held in honour of Death. Catherine approached
the altar, trembling a little, though not agitated. The
pope officiated, desirous of personally completing the
grandeur of his house, and tapers without number
were lighted. The King and Queen of France, with
a crowd of courtiers dressed in the richest costumes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span>
surrounded the altar. Catherine de Medici placed
her cold hand in the faithless hand of Henry of Valois,
which was to deprive the Reform of all liberty, and
France herself, in the <i>Unhappy Peace</i>, of her glory and
her conquests. Clement gave his pontifical blessing
to this tragic pair. The marriage was concluded; the
<i>girl</i>, as Guicciardini calls her, was a wife; her eyes
glanced as with fire. Was it a beam of happiness and
pride? Probably. We might ask also if it was not
the joy of the hyena scenting from afar the graves
where it could feast on the bodies of the dead; or of
the tiger espying from its lair in the African desert
the groups of travellers upon whom it might spring
and quench its raging thirst for blood. But although
the appetites which manifested themselves in the
St. Bartholomew massacre already existed in the germ
in this young wife, there is no evidence (it must be
acknowledged) that she allowed herself to be governed
at Marseilles by these cruel promptings.</p>

<p>There are creatures accursed of God, who, under
a dazzling veil and fair outward show, impart to a
nation an active power of contagion, the venom of
corruption, an invisible principle of death which, circulating
through the veins, infects with its morbid
properties all parts of the body, and strikes the physical
powers with general prostration. It was thus
at the commencement of the history of the human
race that a fallen being deceived man; by him sin
entered into the world, and <i>death by sin</i>. This first
scene, which stands alone, has been repeated, however,
from time to time in the world, though on a smaller
scale. It happened to France when the daughter of
the Medici crept into the family of its kings. No
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>
doubt the disease was already among the people, but
Catherine's arrival was one of those events which bring
the corruption to a head. This woman, so false and
dissolute, so vile as to crawl at the feet of her husband's
mistress and pick up secrets for her; this woman,
who gave birth to none but enervated, idiotic,
distempered, and vicious children, not only corrupted
her own sons, but infected an entire brilliant society
that might have been noble and just (as Coligny
showed), and instilled her deadly venom into its
veins. The niece of the pope poisoned France.</p>

<p>'Clement's joy was incredible,' says Guicciardini.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_479" id="Ref_479" href="#Foot_479">[479]</a></span>
He had even a feeling of gratitude, and resolved to
give the king four <i>hats</i> for four French bishops. Did
he intend that these hats should supply the place of
Urbino, Genoa, Milan, and Naples? Nobody knows.
One of the new cardinals was Odet de Chatillon, then
eleven years old, brother of the immortal Coligny,
and subsequently one of the supporters of protestantism
in France. The king, wishing to appear grateful
for so many favours, wrote to the Bishop of Paris,
that 'as the crime of heresy increased and multiplied,
he should proceed to act against the heretics.'—'Do
not fail,' he added.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_480" id="Ref_480" href="#Foot_480">[480]</a></span>
But the Bishop of Paris, brother
of the diplomatist Du Bellay, was the least inclined
of all the prelates in France to persecution. Francis
knew this well, and for that very reason, perhaps,
gave him the order.</p>

<p class="side">=THE POPE'S HEALTH DECLINES.=</p>

<p>The pope, delighted at having made so good a bargain
in the city of merchants, embarked on the 20th
of November to return to Rome. Excess of joy was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span>
hurtful to him, as it had been to his cousin Leo X.
The threats of the emperor, who demanded a council;
the pressure of Francis I., who claimed Catherine's
<i>three rings</i>;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_481" id="Ref_481" href="#Foot_481">[481]</a></span>
the quarrels of his two nephews, who
were fighting at Florence,—all filled poor Clement
with uneasiness and sorrow. He told his attendants
that his end was near; and immediately after
his return, he had the ring and the garments prepared
which are used at the burial of the popes.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_482" id="Ref_482" href="#Foot_482">[482]</a></span>
His only consolation, the approaching destruction of
the protestants, seemed to fail him in his last days.
Even during his interview with the pope, Francis
was secretly intriguing to unite with the most formidable
of the enemies of Rome. After embracing
the old papacy with apparent emotion, the chivalrous
king gallantly held out his hand to the young Reformation.
In the space of two months he had two
interviews as opposite as possibly could be. These two
contradictory conferences point out one of the traits
that best characterise the versatile and ambitious
Francis. This modern Janus had a head with two faces.
We have just seen that which looked backwards into
the past; we shall soon see that which looked forwards
into the future. But before we follow the King of
France in his oscillation towards Germany and the
protestants, we must return to Calvin. In October
1533, Francis and Clement had met at Marseilles;
and on the 1st of November, while those princes were
still diplomatising, a great evangelical demonstration
took place at Paris.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XXX.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">ADDRESS OF THE RECTOR TO THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS.<br />
 (<span class="smc">November 1533.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">CALVIN had not quitted Paris. He was at one
moment on the boulevards with the merchant De
la Forge, at another in the university quarter with
Cop; in the dwellings of the poor, and the mansions
of the nobles, 'increasing greatly the work of the
Lord,' says Beza, 'not only by teaching truth, but also
by opposing the heretics.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_483" id="Ref_483" href="#Foot_483">[483]</a></span>
He then retired to his
chamber and meditated. He turned his piercing
glance upon the future, and fancied he could see, in
a time more or less remote and through certain
clouds, the triumph of the Gospel. He knew that
the cause of God in general advances painfully; that
there are rocks in the way; that interest, ignorance,
and servility check it at every moment; that it
stumbles and falls, and men may think it ruined. But
Calvin believed that He who is its Head would help
it to overcome all its enemies. 'Only,' he said, 'those
who bear its standard must mount to the assault with
unflinching courage.' Calvin, thinking that the time
for the assault had come, desired that in the university
itself, from that pulpit which all Europe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
respected, the voice of truth should be heard after
centuries of silence. A very natural opportunity
occurred.</p>

<p class="side">=THE CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHY.=</p>

<p>During the month of October Cop was much occupied
with a task that had fallen to him. It was the
custom of the university for the rector to deliver an
inaugural address in Latin on All Saints' Day in one
of the churches of Paris. Calvin thought that it was
his duty to take advantage of this opportunity to proclaim
the Gospel boldly in the face of France. The
rector replied that he was a physician, and that it
was difficult for him to speak like a divine: 'If, however,
you will write the address,' he said, 'I will promise
to deliver it.' The two young men were soon
agreed; they understood the risk they ran, but were
ready to incur it, without presumption however, and
with prudence. They agreed to explain the essence
of the Gospel before the university, giving it the
academic name of <i>Christian Philosophy</i>. 'Christ,'
says Calvin, 'desires us to be like serpents, careful
to avoid all that may hurt us; and yet like doves,
who fly without fear and without care, and who offer
themselves innocently to the fowlers who are laying
snares for them.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_484" id="Ref_484" href="#Foot_484">[484]</a></span></p>

<p>All Saints' Day, 1533, having arrived, the university
assembled with great pomp in the Mathurins'
church; many were impatient to hear Cop, whose
conduct in the case of the Queen of Navarre had
made him an object of suspicion to the Sorbonne.
A great number of monks, and especially of Franciscans,
took their places and opened their ears. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
were however scattered about the church many steadfast
friends of the Gospel, who had come to be present
at the assault and perhaps witness the triumph of their
faith. Among them, and on a bench apart, sat a young
man of humble appearance, calm, modest, and attentive
to all that was said. Nobody suspected that it
was he (Calvin) who was about to set the university,
and indeed all France, in commotion. The hour
having come, all the dignitaries, professors, and students
fixed their eager eyes upon Cop as he rose
to speak. He pronounced the opening address 'in a
very different fashion,' says Theodore Beza, 'from
what was usual.' There was a simplicity and life
in his delivery which contrasted strongly with the
dryness and exaggeration of the old doctors. The
discourse is of importance in the history of the Reformation;
we shall give it, therefore, in part, all the more
because it has lain unknown until this hour among
the manuscripts of the library of Geneva, and is now
first presented to the christian public.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_485" id="Ref_485" href="#Foot_485">[485]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=COP'S INAUGURAL DISCOURSE.=</p>

<p>'Christian philosophy is a great thing,' said the
rector; 'a thing too excellent for any tongue to express
and even for any mind to conceive its value.
The gift of God to man by Jesus Christ himself, it
teaches us to know that true happiness which deceives
nobody, making us believe and comprehend that we
are truly the sons of God.... The brightness of the
splendour of this wisdom of God eclipses all the glimmerings
of the wisdom of the world. It places its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
possessors as far above the common order of men, as
that order is itself above the brutes.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_486" id="Ref_486" href="#Foot_486">[486]</a></span>
The mind of
man, opened and enlarged by the divine hand, then
understands things infinitely more sublime than all
those which are learnt from our feeble humanity.
How admirable, how holy must this divine philosophy
be, since, in order to bring it to men, God was willing
to become man, and, to teach it to us, the Immortal
put on mortality! Could God better manifest his
love to us than by the gift of his eternal Word?
What stronger and tenderer bond could God establish
between himself and us than by becoming a man such
as we are? Sirs, let us praise the other sciences, I
approve of it; let us admire logic, natural philosophy,
and ethics, in consideration of their utility; but who
would dare compare them with that other philosophy,
which explains what philosophers have long been
seeking after and never found ... the will of God?
And what is the hidden will that is revealed to us
here? It is this: <i>The grace of God alone remits sins.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_487" id="Ref_487" href="#Foot_487">[487]</a></span>
...
The Holy Ghost, which sanctifies all hearts and
gives eternal life, is promised to all christians.</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_488" id="Ref_488" href="#Foot_488">[488]</a></span>
If there is any one among you who does not praise this
science above all other sciences, I would ask him,
what will he praise? Would you delight the mind of
man, give him repose of heart, teach him to live holy
and happily? Christian philosophy abundantly supplies
him with these admirable blessings; and, at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
same time, it subdues, as with a wholesome rein, the
impetuous movements of the soul.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_489" id="Ref_489" href="#Foot_489">[489]</a></span>
Sirs, since the
dignity and glory of this Gospel are so great, how I
rejoice that the office with which I am invested calls
upon me to lay it before you to-day!'</p>

<p>This appeared a strange exordium to a great number
of hearers: What! not a word about the saints
whom all catholics glorify on this day?... Let us
wait, however, and see.</p>

<p>The rector then announced that according to
custom he would explain the Gospel of the day, that
is, the beatitudes pronounced by Jesus on the mountain.
'But first of all,' he said, 'unite with me in
earnest prayer to Christ, who is <i>the true and only
intercessor with the Father</i>, in order that by his fertilising
Spirit he may enlighten our understandings,
and that <i>our discourse may praise him, savour of him,
be full of him, and reflect his image, so that this divine
Saviour, penetrating our souls, may water them with the
dew of his heavenly grace</i>!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_490" id="Ref_490" href="#Foot_490">[490]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the rector explained the happiness of those
who are <i>poor in spirit</i>, who <i>mourn</i>, who <i>hunger and
thirst after righteousness</i>.</p>

<p class="side">=THE DISCOURSE CAUSES A SENSATION.=</p>

<p>The university had never heard the like. An
admirable proportion was observed throughout the
address; it was academical and yet evangelical—a
thing not often seen. Calvin had discovered that
tongue of the wise which useth knowledge aright.
But the enemies of the Gospel were not deceived.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
Through the thin veil with which he had covered the
grandeur of divine love, they discovered those heights
and depths of grace which are a source of joy to the
true christian, but an object of abhorrence to the
adversary. There was an indescribable uneasiness
among the auditory. Certain of the hearers exchanged
glances, in this way indicating to one another the
passages which seemed to them the most reprehensible.
University professors, priests, monks, and
students—all listened with astonishment to such unusual
language. Here and there in the congregation
signs of approbation might be observed, but far more
numerous signs of anger. Two Franciscans, in particular,
were so excited that they could scarcely keep
their seats; and when the assembly broke up they
were heard expressing their indignation in loud terms:
'Grace ... God's pardon ... the Holy Ghost ... there
is abundance of all that in the rector's discourse; but
of penance, indulgences, and meritorious works ...
not a word!' It was pointed out to them that the
rector, according to custom, had ended his exordium
with the salutation which the angel had addressed to
Mary; but that, in the opinion of the monks, was a
mere form. The words being in Scripture, how could
the rector refuse to pronounce them? Had he not
besides begun by saying that Christ is the <i>only true</i>
intercessor, <i>verus et unus apud Patrem intercessor</i>?...
What is left then to Mary, except that she is the
mother of the Saviour? The Sorbonne was filled with
anger and alarm.... To select the day of the festival
of <i>All Saints</i>, in order to proclaim that there is <i>only
one</i> intercessor! Such a crime must not remain unpunished.
If Cop wished to produce a sensation, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
monks will produce one also! The two Franciscans
having consulted with their friends, their opinion was
that the university was not to be trusted. Consequently
they hastened to the parliament and laid the
rector's heretical propositions before it.</p>

<p>Cop and Calvin had each retired separately, and
been visited in their respective apartments by many
of their friends. Some of them did not approve of
these great manifestations; they would have wished
the evangelicals to be content with a few small conventicles
here and there in retired places. Calvin did
not agree with them. In his opinion there was one
single universal christian Church, which had existed
since the time of the apostles, and would exist always.
The errors and abuses abounding in christendom, profane
priests, hypocrites, scandalous sinners, do not
prevent the Church from existing. True, it is often
reduced to little more than a small humble flock; but
the flock exists, and it must, whenever it has the
opportunity, manifest itself in opposition to a fallen
catholicism. The reformers themselves, though it
is frequently forgotten, maintained the doctrine of a
universal Church; but while Rome counts among the
number of signs which characterise it 'a certain pomp
and temporal possessions,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_491" id="Ref_491" href="#Foot_491">[491]</a></span>
the evangelical doctors, on
the contrary, reckon persecution and the cross as a
mark of the true Church. Cop and Calvin were to
make the experiment in their own persons.</p>

<p class="side">=DEBATES IN THE UNIVERSITY.=</p>

<p>The rector was not inclined to give way to the
monks: he resolved to join battle on a question of
form, which would dispose his colleagues in his favour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
and perhaps in favour of truth. It was a maxim
received in the university, that all its members, and <i>a
fortiori</i> its head, must be tried first by the corporation,
and that it was not permissible to pass over any
degree of jurisdiction.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_492" id="Ref_492" href="#Foot_492">[492]</a></span>
Accordingly, on the 19th of
November, the rector convoked the four faculties, and,
having undertaken the defence of his address, complained
bitterly that certain persons had dared to
carry the matter before a foreign body. The privileges
of the university had thus been attacked. 'It has
been insulted by this denunciation of its chief to
the parliament,' said Cop; 'and these impudent informers
must give satisfaction for the insult.'</p>

<p>These words excited a great commotion in the
assembly. The theologians, who had hung down
their heads in the case of the Queen of Navarre,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">... N'osant approfondir</div>
<div class="verse">De ces hautes puissances</div>
<div class="verse">Les moins pardonnables offenses,</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">resolved to compensate themselves by falling with their
whole strength upon a plain doctor, who was besides by
birth a Swiss. Every one of them raised a cry against
him. The university was divided into two distinct
parties, and the meeting reechoed with the most contradictory
appeals. The theologians shouted loudest:
'Time presses,' they said; 'the crisis has arrived. If
we yield, the Romish doctrine, vanquished and expelled
from the university, will give place to the new
errors. Heresy is at our gates; we must crush it by a
single blow!'—'The Gospel, philosophy, and liberty!'
said one party.—'Popery, tradition, and submission!'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
said the other. The noise and disturbance became such
that nothing could be heard. At last the question
was put to the vote: two faculties, those of letters and
medicine, were for Cop's proposition; and two, namely,
law and divinity, were against it. The rector, to show
his moderation, refused to vote, being unwilling to
give the victory to himself.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_493" id="Ref_493" href="#Foot_493">[493]</a></span>
The meeting broke up
in the greatest confusion.</p>

<p>The rector's address, and the discussions to which it
gave rise, made a great noise at court as well as in the
city; but no one took more interest in it than the
Queen of Navarre. The question of her poetry had
been the first act; Calvin's address was the second.
Margaret knew that he was the real author of the
discourse. She always granted her special patronage
to the students trained in any of her schools. She
watched the young scholars with the most affectionate
interest, and rejoiced in their successes. There was
not one of them that could be compared with Calvin,
who had studied at Bourges, Margaret's university.
The purity of his doctrine, the boldness of his profession,
the majesty of his language, astonished everybody,
and had particularly struck the queen. Calvin
was one of her students for whom she anticipated the
highest destinies. That princess was not indeed formed
for resistance; the mildness of her character inclined
her to yield; and of this she was well aware. About
this time, being commissioned by the king to transact
certain business with one of her relations, a very
headstrong woman, she wrote to Montmorency, 'Employ
a head better steeled than mine, or you will not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
succeed. She is a Norman woman, and smells of the
sea; I am an Anjoumoise, sprinkled with the soft
waters of the Charente.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_494" id="Ref_494" href="#Foot_494">[494]</a></span>
But, mild as she was,
she took this matter of Cop and Calvin seriously
to heart. When the friends of the Gospel placed the
candle boldly on the candlestick to give light to all
France, should a violent wind come and extinguish it?</p>

<p class="side">=INTERVIEW OF CALVIN AND MARGARET.=</p>

<p>The Queen of Navarre summoned Calvin to the
court, Beza informs us.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_495" id="Ref_495" href="#Foot_495">[495]</a></span>
... The news circulated
immediately among the evangelical christians, who
entertained great hopes from it. 'The Queen of
Navarre,' they said, 'the king's only sister, is favourable
to true religion. Perhaps the Lord, by the intervention
of that admirable woman, will disperse the
impending storm.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_496" id="Ref_496" href="#Foot_496">[496]</a></span>
Calvin accordingly went to court.
The ladies-in-waiting having introduced him into the
queen's apartment, she rose to meet him, and made
him sit down by her side, 'receiving him with great
honour,' says Beza, 'and hearing him with much
pleasure.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_497" id="Ref_497" href="#Foot_497">[497]</a></span>
The two finest geniuses which France
then possessed were thus brought face to face—the
man of the people and the queen, so different in outward
appearance and even as to the point of view from
which they regarded the Reform, but yet both animated
with an ardent desire to see the triumph of the
Gospel. They communicated their thoughts to each
other. Calvin, notwithstanding the persecution, was
full of courage. He knew that the Church of Christ
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
is exposed to changes and error, like all human things,
and the state of christendom, in his opinion, showed
this full clearly; but he believed that it possessed an
incorruptible power of life, and that, at the very
moment when it seemed entirely fallen and ruined, it
had by the Holy Spirit the ability to rise again and be
renewed. The hour of this renewal had arrived, and
it was as impossible for men to retard it as to prevent
the spring-time from budding and covering the earth
with leaves, blossoms, and fruit. Yet Calvin was
under no delusion as to the dangers which threatened
evangelical christianity. 'When the peril is imminent,'
he said, 'it is not the time to indulge ourselves
like silly, careless people; the fear of danger, serving
as an incentive, should lead us to ask for God's help,
and to put on our armour without trembling.' The
queen promised to use all her influence to calm the
storm. Calvin was conducted out of the palace with
the same attentions that had been paid him when he
entered it. He afterwards spoke about this interview
to Theodore Beza, who has handed it down to us.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_498" id="Ref_498" href="#Foot_498">[498]</a></span></p>

<p>Still the sky became more threatening. The parliament,
paying no respect to the privileges of the
university, had entertained the complaint of the
monks; the rector, therefore, received a message from
this sovereign court summoning him to appear before
it. Calvin knew quite well that a similar process
would soon reach him; but he never shrank back
either from before the despotism of an unjust power,
or from the popular fury. 'We are not in the school
of a Plato,' he said, 'where, sitting in the shade, we can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></span>
indulge in idle discussions. Christ nobly maintained
his doctrines before Pilate, and can we be so cowardly
as to forsake him?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_499" id="Ref_499" href="#Foot_499">[499]</a></span>
Cop, strengthened by his friend,
determined to appear to the summons of the parliament.
That body had great power, no doubt; but
the rector said to himself that the university possessed
incontestable privileges, and that all learned Europe
had been for many centuries almost at its feet. He
resolved to support its rights, to accuse his accusers,
and to reprimand the parliament for stepping out of
the lawful course. Cop, therefore, got himself ready
to appear, as became the head of the first university
of the christian world. He put on his academical
robes, and preceded by the beadles and apparitors,
with their maces and gold-headed staves,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_500" id="Ref_500" href="#Foot_500">[500]</a></span>
set out
with great ceremony for the Palace of Justice.</p>

<p class="side">=COP GOES IN STATE TO THE PARLIAMENT.=</p>

<p>He was going to his death. The parliament, as
well as Calvin, had understood the position, but had
arrived at very different conclusions. It saw that
the hour was come to strike the blow that would
crush the Reformation, and had resolved to arrest
the rector even in the court. The absence of the
king was an opportunity of which they must hasten to
take advantage. A signal vengeance, inflicted in full
parliament, was to expiate a crime not less signal,
committed in the presence of the whole university.
A member of the court, converted to the Gospel, determined
to save the unfortunate Cop, and sent a
trusty man to warn him of the impending danger.
As he quitted the great hall, the messenger caught
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span>
sight of the archers who had been sent for to arrest
the rector: might it not be too late to save him? Cop
was already on the road and approaching the palace,
accompanied by a crowd of students, citizens, and
common people, some full of good wishes, others
curious to learn the issue of this singular duel between
the parliament and the university. The man
sent to forewarn the rector arrived just as the university
procession was passing through a narrow
street. Taking advantage of a momentary confusion
occasioned by the crowd, he approached Cop, and
whispered in his ear: 'Beware of the enemy;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_501" id="Ref_501" href="#Foot_501">[501]</a></span>
they intend shutting you up in the Conciergerie; Berquin's
fate awaits you; I have seen the officers authorised
to seize you; if you go farther, you are a dead man.'
... What was to be done?... If it had been Calvin
instead of Cop, he would perhaps have gone on. I cannot
tell; for the peril was imminent, and it appeared
doubtful if anything would be gained by braving it.
However that may be, Cop was only Calvin's double; it
was his friend's faith that urged him forward more perhaps
than his own. To stand firm in the day of tempest,
man must cling to the rock without human help; Cop,
overtaken by this news of death at the very moment
he fancied he was marching to victory, lost his presence
of mind, stopped the procession, was suddenly
surrounded by several friends, and, the disorder being
thus augmented, he escaped and hastily returned
home.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_502" id="Ref_502" href="#Foot_502">[502]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE RECTOR'S FLIGHT.=</p>

<p>Where shall he go now? There could be no doubt
that the parliament would seize him wherever he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">{277}</a></span>
could be found; his friends therefore insisted that he
should quit France. He was strongly inclined to do
so: Basle, the asylum of his master Erasmus, was his
native place, and he was sure of finding a shelter
there. Cop flung off the academical dress, the cap
and gown, which would have betrayed him;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_503" id="Ref_503" href="#Foot_503">[503]</a></span>
caught
up hurriedly what was necessary for his journey, and
by mistake, some say, carried away the university
seal with him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_504" id="Ref_504" href="#Foot_504">[504]</a></span>
I rather believe he did so designedly;
compelled to yield to force, he desired, even when far
from Paris, to retain the insignia of that illustrious
body. His friends hurried him; at any moment the
house might be surrounded; he quitted it stealthily,
escaped out of Paris, and fled along the road which
leads to Basle, using every precaution to conceal himself
from the pursuit of his enemies. When the archers
went to his house, they searched it in vain: the
rector had disappeared.</p>

<p>The parliament, exasperated at this escape, promised
a reward of three hundred crowns to any one
who should bring back the fugitive rector, <i>dead or
alive</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_505" id="Ref_505" href="#Foot_505">[505]</a></span>
But Cop in his disguise eluded every eye;
he succeeded through innumerable dangers in getting
safely out of the kingdom, and arrived in Switzerland.
He was saved; but the Reformation was threatened
with a still more terrible blow.</p>

<p>The Roman party consoled themselves a little for
this escape by saying that Cop was only a puppet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
and that the man who had pulled the strings was still
in their power. 'It is Calvin,' they said, 'whom we
must seize. He is a daring adventurer, a rash determined
man, resolved to make the world talk of him
like that incendiary of the temple of Diana, of whom
history speaks. He will keep all Europe in disquietude,
and will build up a new world. If he is
permitted to live, he will be the Luther ... the firebrand
of France.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_506" id="Ref_506" href="#Foot_506">[506]</a></span></p>

<p>The lieutenant-criminal, Jean Morin, had kept his
eye for some time upon the young doctor. He had
discovered his activity in increasing the heretical sect,
and also his secret conferences with Cop. His agents
were on his track whenever Calvin went by night to
teach from house to house.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_507" id="Ref_507" href="#Foot_507">[507]</a></span>
... Cop was the shadow,
said the monks; if the shadow escapes us, let us
strike the substance. The parliament ordered the
lieutenant-criminal to seize the reformer and shut
him up in the Conciergerie.</p>

<p class="side">=FLIGHT OF CALVIN.=</p>

<p>Calvin, trusting to his obscurity and, under God, to
the protection of the Queen of Navarre, was sitting
quietly in his room in the college of Fortret.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_508" id="Ref_508" href="#Foot_508">[508]</a></span>
He was not however free from emotion; he was thinking
of what had happened to Cop, but did not believe
that the persecution would reach him. His friends,
however, did not share in this rash security. Those
who had helped Cop to escape, seeing the rector out
of his enemies' reach, said to themselves that the same
danger threatened Calvin.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_509" id="Ref_509" href="#Foot_509">[509]</a></span>
They entered his chamber
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span>
at a time when they were least expected. 'Fly!'
they said to him, 'or you are lost.' He still hesitated.
Meanwhile the lieutenant-criminal arrived before the
college with his sergeants. Several students immediately
hurried to their comrade, told him what was
going on, and entreated him to flee. But scarcely
have they spoken, when heavy steps are heard: it is
no longer time.... The officers are there! It was the
noise made by them at Calvin's door (says an historian)
which made him comprehend the danger that
threatened him. Perhaps the college gate is meant,
rather than the door of the reformer's own room.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_510" id="Ref_510" href="#Foot_510">[510]</a></span>
In either case, the moment was critical; but if they
could manage to gain only a few minutes, the young
evangelist might escape. His noble, frank, and sympathetic
soul conciliated the hearts of all who knew
him. He always possessed devoted friends, and they
did not fail him now. The window of his room
opened into the street of the Bernardins. They lost
not a moment: some of those who came to warn him
engaged the attention of Morin and his officers for a
few minutes; others remaining with Calvin twisted
the bed-clothes into a rope, and fastened them to the
window. Calvin, leaving his manuscripts scattered
about, caught hold of the sheets and lowered himself
down to the ground.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_511" id="Ref_511" href="#Foot_511">[511]</a></span>
He was not the first
of Christ's servants who had taken that road to escape
death. When the Jews of Damascus conspired against
Paul, 'the disciples took him by night and let him
down by the wall in a basket.'—'Thus early,' says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span>
Calvin, 'Paul went through his apprenticeship of
carrying the cross in after years.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_512" id="Ref_512" href="#Foot_512">[512]</a></span></p>

<p>He had hardly disappeared when the lieutenant-criminal,
notorious for his excessive cruelty,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_513" id="Ref_513" href="#Foot_513">[513]</a></span>
entered the room, and was astonished to find no one there.
The youthful doctor had escaped like a bird from the
net of the fowler. Morin ordered some of his sergeants
to pursue the fugitive, and then proceeded to examine
carefully all the heretic's papers, hoping to find something
that might compromise other Lutherans. He
did lay his hand on certain letters and documents
which afterwards exposed Calvin's friends to great
danger, and even to death.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_514" id="Ref_514" href="#Foot_514">[514]</a></span>
Morin docketed them,
tied them up carefully in a bundle, and withdrew.
The cruel hatred which animated him against the
evangelical christians had been still further increased
by his failure.</p>

<p>Calvin, having landed in the street of the Bernardins,
entered that of St. Victor, and then proceeded towards
the suburb of that name. At the extremity of this
suburb, not far from the open country (a catholic
historian informs us), dwelt a vine-dresser, a member
of the little church of Paris. Calvin went to this
honest protestant's and told him what had just happened.
The vine-dresser, who probably had heard
him explain the Scriptures at their secret meetings,
moved with a fatherly affection for the young man,
proposed to change clothes with him. Forthwith, says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
the canon to whom we are indebted for the account,
Calvin took off his own garments and put on the peasant's
old-fashioned coat. With a hoe on one shoulder,
and a wallet on the other, in which the vine-dresser
had placed some provisions, he started again. If Morin
had sent his officers after him, they might have passed
by the fugitive reformer under this rustic disguise.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN IS RECOGNISED.=</p>

<p>He was not far beyond the suburbs of Paris, however,
when he saw a canon whom he knew coming
towards him. The latter with astonishment fixed a
curious look on the vine-dresser, and fancying him to
be very unlike a stout peasant, he drew near, stopped,
and recognised him. He knew what was the matter,
for all Paris was full of it. The canon immediately remonstrated
with him: 'Change your manner of life,'
he said; 'look to your salvation, and I will promise
to procure you <i>a good appointment</i>.' But Calvin,
'who was hot-headed,' replied: 'I shall go through
with it to the last.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_515" id="Ref_515" href="#Foot_515">[515]</a></span>
The canon afterwards related
this incident to the Abbot de Genlis, who told it to
Desmay.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_516" id="Ref_516" href="#Foot_516">[516]</a></span></p>

<p>Is this a story invented in the idle talk of a cloister?
I think not. Some of the details, particularly the
language of the canon, render it probable. It was
also by the promise of a 'good appointment' that
Francis de Sales endeavoured to win over Theodore
Beza. Simony is a sin so <i>innocent</i> that three priests,
a canon, an abbot, and a doctor of the Sorbonne, combine
to relate this peccadillo. If the language of the
canon is in conformity with his character, Calvin's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
answer, 'I will go through with it to the last,' is also
in his manner. Although we may have some trouble
to picture the young reformer disguised as a peasant,
with his wallet and hoe, we thought it our duty to
relate an incident transmitted to us by his enemies.
The circumstance is really not singular. Calvin was
then beginning an exodus which has gone on unceasingly
for nearly three centuries. The disciples
of the Gospel in France, summoned to abjure Christ,
have fled from their executioners by thousands, and
under various disguises. And if the gravity of
history permitted the author to revert to the stories
that charmed his childhood, he could tell how many
a time, seated at the feet of his grandmother and
listening with attentive ear, he has heard her describe
how her mother, a little girl at the time of the
Revocation in 1685, escaped from France, concealed
in a basket which her father, a pious huguenot, disguised
as a peasant, carried carefully on his back.</p>

<p>Calvin, having escaped his enemies, hurried away
from the capital, from his cherished studies and his
brethren, and wandered up and down, avoiding the
places where he might be recognised. He thought
over all that had happened, and his meditative mind
drew wholesome lessons from it. He learnt from his
own experience by what token to recognise the true
Church of Christ. 'We should lose our labour,' he
said in later days, thinking perhaps of this circumstance,
'if we wished to separate Christ from his cross;
it is a natural thing for the world to hate Christ, even
in his members. There will always be wicked men
to prick us like thorns. If they do not draw the sword,
they spit out their venom, and either gnash their teeth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">{283}</a></span>
or excite some great disturbance.' The sword was
already 'drawn' against him: acting, therefore, with
prudence, he followed the least frequented roads,
sleeping in the cottages or the mansions of his friends.
It is asserted that being known by the Sieur de Hasseville,
whose château was situated beyond Versailles, he
remained there some time in hiding.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_517" id="Ref_517" href="#Foot_517">[517]</a></span></p>

<p>The king's first movement, when he heard of Cop's
business and the flight of Calvin, was one of anger and
persecution. Duprat, formerly first president of parliament,
was much exasperated at the affront offered
to that body. Francis commanded every measure to
be taken to discover the person who had warned Cop
of his danger; he would have had him punished
severely as a favourer of heresy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_518" id="Ref_518" href="#Foot_518">[518]</a></span>
At the same time,
he ordered the prosecution of those persons whom the
papers seized in Calvin's room pointed out as partisans
of the new doctrine.</p>

<p class="side">=MANY EVANGELICALS QUIT PARIS.=</p>

<p>There was a general alarm among the evangelicals,
and many left Paris. A Dominican friar, brother of
De la Croix, feeling a growing thirst for knowledge,
deliberated in his convent whether he ought not to
remove to a country where the Gospel was preached
freely.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_519" id="Ref_519" href="#Foot_519">[519]</a></span>
He was one of those compromised by Calvin's
papers. He therefore made his escape, reached Neufchatel,
and thence proceeded to Geneva, where we
shall meet him again.</p>

<p>The greater part of the friends of the Gospel, however,
remained in France: Margaret exerted all her
influence with her brother to ward off the impending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">{284}</a></span>
blow, and succeeded in appeasing the storm.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_520" id="Ref_520" href="#Foot_520">[520]</a></span>
Francis
was always between two contrary currents, one coming
from Duprat, the other from his sister; and once more
he followed the better.</p>

<p>The Queen of Navarre, exhausted by all these
shocks, disgusted with the dissipations of the court,
distressed by the hatred of which the Gospel was the
object among all around her, turned her face towards
the Pyrenees. Paris, St. Germain, Fontainebleau,
had no more charms for her; besides, her health was
not strong, and she desired to pass the winter at Pau.
But, above all, she sighed for solitude, liberty, and
meditation; she had need of Christ. She therefore
bade farewell to the brilliant court of France, and
departed for the quiet Béarn.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XXXI.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">CONFERENCE AND ALLIANCE BETWEEN FRANCIS I.
                             AND PHILIP OF HESSE AT BAR-LE-DUC.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Winter 1533-34.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="side">=PROPOSED GERMAN ALLIANCE.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ALMOST about the same time, Francis bent his
steps towards the Rhine. The establishment of
the Reform throughout Europe depended, as many
thought, on the union of France with protestant Germany.
This union would emancipate France from the
papal supremacy, and all christendom would then be
seen turning to the Gospel. The king was preparing
to hold a conference with the most decided of the protestant
princes of Germany. Rarely has an interview
between two sovereigns been of so much importance.</p>

<p>Francis I. had hardly quitted Marseilles and arrived
at Avignon, when he assembled his council (25th of
November, 1533), and communicated to it the desire
for an alliance which the German protestants had expressed
to him. A certain shame had prevented him
from moving in the matter, amid the caresses which
papacy and royalty were lavishing upon each other at
Marseilles. But now that Clement was on board his
galleys, nothing prevented the King of France, who
had given his right hand to the pontiff, from giving
his left to the heretics.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_522" id="Ref_522" href="#Foot_522">[522]</a></span>
There were many reasons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">{286}</a></span>
why he should do so. The clergy were not allies
for whose support he was eager: the best orthodoxy,
in his eyes, was the iron arm of the lansquenets.
Besides, the opportunity was unprecedented: in fact,
he could at one stroke gain the protestants to his cause,
and inflict an immense injury on Austria—that is to
say, on Charles V.</p>

<p>It will no doubt be remembered that the young
Prince of Wurtemberg, whom the emperor was leading
in his train across the Alps, having escaped with
his governor, had loudly demanded back the states
of which Austria had robbed his father. Francis was
chiefly occupied about him at Avignon. 'At this
place,' says the historian Martin du Bellay, 'the king
assembled his council, and deliberated on a request
made to him not only by young Duke Christopher
of Wurtemberg and his father, but by his uncles,
Duke William and Duke Louis of Bavaria. Christopher
himself had written to Francis I.: "Sire," he
said, "during the great and long calamity of my
father and myself, what first made hope spring up in
our hearts was the thought that you would interpose
your influence to put an end to our misery.... Your
compassion for the afflicted is well known. I doubt
not that, by your assistance, we shall soon be restored
to our rights."'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_523" id="Ref_523" href="#Foot_523">[523]</a></span></p>

<p>Francis, always on the watch to injure his rival,
was delighted at this proceeding, and did not conceal
his joy from the privy council. 'I desire much,' he
said, 'to see the dukes of Wurtemberg restored to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
states, and should like to help them, as much to weaken
the emperor's power as to acquire new friendships in
Germany. But,' he added, 'I would do it under so
<i>colourable a pretext</i>, that I may affirm that I have infringed
no treaty.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_524" id="Ref_524" href="#Foot_524">[524]</a></span>
To humble the emperor and to
exalt the protestants, without appearing to have anything
to do with it, was what Francis desired.</p>

<p class="side">=DU BELLAY SENT TO GERMANY.=</p>

<p>William du Bellay urged the king to return the
duke a favourable answer. A friend of independence
and sound liberty, he was at that time the representative
of the old French spirit, as Catherine de Medici
was to become the representative of the new—that is
to say, of the Romish influence under which France
has unhappily suffered for nearly three centuries. It
has been sometimes said that the cause of France is
the cause of Rome; but the noblest aspirations of the
French people and its most generous representatives
condemn this error. Popery is the cause of the pope
alone; it is not even the cause of Italy; and if the
contrary opinion still exists in France, it is a remnant
of the influence of the Medici.</p>

<p>The transition from Marseilles to Avignon was,
however, a little abrupt. To ally the eldest son of
the Church with the protestants at the very moment
he left the pope's arms, in a city which belonged to
the holy see, and in the ancient palace of the pontiffs,
seemed strange to the French, whose eyes were still
fascinated by the pomp of Rome. This was noticed
by Du Bellay, who, wishing to facilitate the transition,
explained to the council 'that a diet was about to be
held at Augsburg, where the reparation of a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
injustice would be discussed; that an innocent person
implored the king's assistance; that it was the practice
of France to succour the oppressed everywhere;
that precious advantages might result from it ...
besides, there could be no doubt of success, and as
the cause of Duke Christopher would be conducted
in the diet according to the rights, usages, immunities,
and privileges of the German nation, the emperor
could not prevent justice being done.... Let us send
an ambassador,' added Du Bellay, 'to support the
claims of the dukes of Wurtemberg, and Austria
must either restore these princes to their states, or
arouse the hostility of all Germany against it.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_525" id="Ref_525" href="#Foot_525">[525]</a></span>
Francis was already gained. He hoped not only to take
Wurtemberg from Austria, but also to get up a general
war in Germany between the protestants and the
empire, of which he could take advantage to seize
upon the states which he claimed in Italy. When his
detested rival had fallen beneath their combined blows,
the religious question should be settled. The king,
who had meditated all this in the intervals of his
conferences with Clement VII., ordered Du Bellay to
proceed to Augsburg forthwith, and charged him 'to
do everything in his power, <i>with a sufficiently colourable
pretext</i>, towards the re-establishment of the
dukes of Wurtemberg.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_526" id="Ref_526" href="#Foot_526">[526]</a></span>
Du Bellay was satisfied.
He wished for more than the king did; he desired
to emancipate France from the papal supremacy,
and with that object to draw Francis and protestantism
closer together. That was difficult; but this
Wurtemberg affair, which presented itself simply as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">{289}</a></span>
a political question, would supply him with the means
of overcoming every difficulty. This was where he
would have to set the wedge in order to split the tree.
He thought that he could make use of it to counteract
the effects of the conference which the king had just
held with the pope by contriving another between
the two most anti-papistical princes in Europe. Du
Bellay departed, taking the road through Switzerland.</p>

<p class="side">=DU BELLAY IN SWITZERLAND.=</p>

<p>He had his reasons for adopting this route. The
emperor and his brother consented, indeed, that their
rights should be discussed in the diet, but it was only
that they might not appear to refuse to do justice:
everybody knew that Ferdinand had no intention of
restoring Wurtemberg. The balance was at that time
pretty even in Germany between Rome and the Gospel,
and the restitution of Wurtemberg would make it
incline to the side of the Reformation. If Austria
would not give way, she would have to be constrained
by force of arms. Du Bellay desired, therefore, to
induce the protestant cantons of Switzerland, bordering
on Wurtemberg, to unite their efforts with those
of protestant Germany in wresting that duchy from
the Austrian rule. Francis, who knew how to manage
such matters, had conceived the design of placing in
the hands of the Helvetians, probably through Du
Bellay, a certain sum of money to cover the expenses
of the campaign. But it seems that the protestant
cantons did not agree to the arrangement.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_527" id="Ref_527" href="#Foot_527">[527]</a></span></p>

<p>When Du Bellay arrived at Augsburg, he met the
young Duke Christopher. He entered into conversation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">{290}</a></span>
with him, and they were henceforth inseparable:
this prince, so amiable, but at the same time so
firm, was his man. He is to be the lever which
the counsellor of Francis I. will use to stir men's
minds, and to unite Germany and France.... The
first thing to be done was to restore him to his
throne. The French ambassador paid a visit to the
delegates from Austria. 'The king my master,'
he said, 'is delighted that this innocent young man
has at last found a harbour in the midst of the
tempest. His father and he have suffered enough
by being driven from their home.... It is time to
restore the son to the father, the father to the son, and
to both of them the states of their ancestors. If
entreaties are not sufficient,' added Du Bellay firmly,
'the king my master will employ all his power.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_528" id="Ref_528" href="#Foot_528">[528]</a></span>
Thus did France take up her position as the protector
of the distressed; but there was something else underneath:
the chief object of the king was to strike a blow
at the emperor; that of Du Bellay, to strike the pope.</p>

<p>Christopher, who received encouragement from
every quarter, appeared before the diet on the 10th
of December, 1533. He was no longer the captive
prince whom Charles had led in his train. The poor
young man, who not long ago had been compelled to
flee, leaving his companion behind him, hidden among
the reeds of a marsh in the Norican Alps, stood now
before the German diet, surrounded by a brilliant
throng of nobles, the representatives of the princes
who supported his claims, and having as <i>assistants</i>
(that is, as espousing his quarrel) the delegates of
Saxony, Prussia, Brunswick, Mecklenburg, Luneburg,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">{291}</a></span>
Hesse, Cleves, Munster, and Juliers. The
King of Hungary pleaded his cause in person:
'Most noble seigniors,' he began, 'when we see the
young Duke Christopher of Wurtemberg deprived of
his duchy without having done anything to deserve
such punishment, disappointed by the Austrians in all
the hopes they had given him, unworthily treated at
the imperial court,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_529" id="Ref_529" href="#Foot_529">[529]</a></span>
compelled to make his escape by
flight, imploring at this moment by earnest supplications
your compassion and your help—we are profoundly
agitated. What! because his father has done
wrong, shall this young man be reduced to a hard and
humiliating life? Has not the voice of God himself
declared that the son shall not bear the iniquities of
the father?'</p>

<p class="side">=UNION TO ASSIST WURTEMBERG.=</p>

<p>The Austrian commissioners, finding their position
rather embarrassing, began to temporise, and proposed
that Christopher should accept as compensation some
town of small importance. He refused, saying: 'I
will never cease to claim simply and firmly the country
of my fathers.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_530" id="Ref_530" href="#Foot_530">[530]</a></span>
But Austria, fearing the preponderance
of protestantism in Germany, closed her ears to
his just request. At this point France intervened
strongly in favour of the two protestant princes. Du
Bellay, after reminding the diet that Ulrich had confessed
his faults, and that he was much altered by
age, long exile, and great trials, continued thus:
'Must the duke see his only son, a young and innocent
prince, who ought to be the support of his declining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">{292}</a></span>
years, for ever bearing the weight of his misfortunes?
Will you take into consideration neither the calamitous
old age of the one, nor the unhappy youth of the
other? Will you avenge the sins of the father upon
the child who was then in the cradle? The dukes of
Wurtemberg are of high descent. Their punishment
has been permitted, but not their destruction. Help
this innocent youth (Christopher), receive this penitent
(Ulrich), and reestablish them both in their
former dignity.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_531" id="Ref_531" href="#Foot_531">[531]</a></span></p>

<p>The Austrians, who were annoyed at seeing the
ambassador of the King of France intermeddling in
their affairs, held firm. The deputies of Saxony,
Hesse, Prussia, Mecklenburg, and the other states,
now made up their minds to oppose Austria; they
told the young duke that they were ready to cast
their swords in the balance, and Christopher himself
requested Du Bellay 'to change his congratulatory
oration into a comminatory one.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_532" id="Ref_532" href="#Foot_532">[532]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=DU BELLAY PLEADS AND MENACES.=</p>

<p>When the French envoy was admitted again before
the diet, he assumed a higher tone: 'My lords,' he
said, 'will you lend your hands to the ruin of an
innocent person?... If you do so ... I tell you that
you will bring a stain upon your reputation that all
the water in the sea will not be able to wash out.
This prince, in heart so proud, in origin so illustrious,
will not endure to live miserably in the country whose
sovereign he is by birth; he will go into a foreign land.
And in what part soever of the world he may be,
what will he carry with him?... The shame of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">{293}</a></span>
emperor, the shame of King Ferdinand, the shame of
all of you. Every man, pointing to him, will say:
That is he who formerly.... That is he who now....
That is he who through no fault of his own.... That
is he who, being compelled to leave Germany.... You
understand, my lords, what is omitted in these sentences;
I willingly excuse myself from completing
them ... you will do it yourselves. No! you will
not be insensible to such great misery.... I see your
hearts are touched already.... I see by your gestures
and your looks that you feel the truth of my
words.'</p>

<p>Then, making a direct attack upon the emperor and
his brother, he said: 'There are people who, very
erroneously in my opinion, consult only their wicked
ambition and unbridled covetousness, and who think
that, by oppressing now one and now another, they
will subdue all Germany.'</p>

<p>Turning next to the young Prince of Wurtemberg,
the representative of Francis I. continued: 'Duke
Christopher, rely upon it the Most Christian King will
do all that he can in your behalf, without injury to
his faith, his honour, and the duties of blood. The
court of France has always been the most liberal
of all—ever open to receive exiled and suffering
princes. With greater reason, then, it will not be
closed against you who are its ally ... you who,
by the justice of your cause and by your innocence,
appear even to your enemies worthy of pity and
compassion.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_533" id="Ref_533" href="#Foot_533">[533]</a></span></p>

<p>The members of the diet had listened attentively to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">{294}</a></span>
this speech, and their countenances showed that they
were convinced.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_534" id="Ref_534" href="#Foot_534">[534]</a></span>
The cause was won: the Swabian
league, the creature of Austria and the enemy of the
Reformation, was not to be renewed. Du Bellay left
Augsburg, continued his journey through Germany,
and endeavoured to form a new confederation there<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_535" id="Ref_535" href="#Foot_535">[535]</a></span>
against Austria, which Francis I. and Henry VIII.
could join. 'If any one should think of invading
England,' the latter was told, 'we would send you
soldiers <i>by the Baltic sea</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_536" id="Ref_536" href="#Foot_536">[536]</a></span>
It is to be feared that
this succour by way of the Baltic would have arrived
rather late in the waters of the Thames. But the
main thing in Du Bellay's eyes was action, not
diplomatic negotiations. His idea was to unite
Francis I. and the protestants of Germany in a common
movement which would lead France to throw off
the ultramontane yoke; but there were only two men
of sufficient energy to undertake it. The first was
the king his master, to whom we now return.</p>

<p>Francis, after leaving Avignon, had gone into Dauphiny,
thence to Lyons and other cities in the east
of France. In January 1534, he reached Bar-le-Duc,
thus gradually drawing nearer to the German frontier.
The winter this year was exceedingly severe, but for
that the king did not care: he thought only of uniting
France and the protestants by means of Wurtemberg,
as the marriage of Catherine had just united France
and the pope.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">{295}</a></div>

<p class="side">=THE LANDGRAVE'S PROJECT.=</p>

<p>The second of the princes from whom an energetic
course might be expected was the Landgrave of Hesse.
Of all the protestant leaders of Germany he was the
one whose heart had been least changed by the Gospel.
Without equalling Francis I. in sensuality, he was yet
far from being a pattern of chastity. But, on the
other hand, none of the princes attached to the Reformation
equalled him in talent, strength, and activity.
By his character he was the most important man of
the evangelical league, and more than once he exercised
a decisive influence on the progress of the protestant
work. Philip, cousin of the Duke of Wurtemberg,
often had him at his court; Ulrich had
even taken part in the famous conference of Marburg.
Moved by the misfortunes of this prince, delighted
at the trick Christopher had played the emperor,
touched by the loyalty of the Wurtembergers, who
claimed their dukes and their nationality, impatient to
win this part of Germany to the evangelical faith, he
desired to take it away from Austria. To find the
men to do it was easy, if only he had the money ...
but money he had none.</p>

<p>Du Bellay saw that there lay the knot of the affair,
and he made haste to cut it. The clergy of France
had just given the king a considerable sum: could a
better use be made of it than this? The French envoy
let Philip know that he might obtain from his master
the subsidies he needed. But more must be done: he
must take advantage of the opportunity to bring together
the two most enterprising princes of the epoch.
If they saw and heard one another, they would like
each other and bind themselves in such a manner that
the union of France and protestant Germany would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">{296}</a></span>
be effected at last. Philip of Hesse received all these
overtures with delight.</p>

<p class="side">=LUTHER OPPOSES THE WAR.=</p>

<p>But fresh obstacles now intervened. The theologians
of the Reformation detested these foreign alliances
and wars, which, in their opinion, defiled the
holiest of causes. Luther and Melanchthon waited
upon the elector, conjuring him to oppose the landgrave's
rash enterprise; and Du Bellay found the two
reformers employing as much zeal to prevent the
union of Francis and Philip as he to accomplish it.
'Go,' said the elector to Luther and Melanchthon,
'and prevail upon the landgrave to change his
mind.'</p>

<p>The two doctors, on their way from Wittemberg to
Weimar, where they would meet Philip, conversed
about their mission and the landgrave: 'He is an intelligent
prince,' said Luther, 'all animation and impulse,
and of a joyous heart. He has been able to
maintain order in his country, so that Hesse, which is
full of forests and mountains where robbers might
find shelter, sees its inhabitants travelling and roaming
about, buying and selling without fear.... If one
of them is attacked and robbed, forthwith the landgrave
falls upon the bandits and punishes them. He
is a true man of war—an Arminius. His star never
deceives him, and he is much dreaded by all his adversaries.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_537" id="Ref_537" href="#Foot_537">[537]</a></span>
'And I too,' said Melanchthon, 'love the
<i>Macedonian</i>' (for so he called Philip of Hesse, because,
in his opinion, that prince had all the shrewdness
and courage of his namesake of Macedon); 'for that
reason,' he added, 'I am unwilling that, being so high,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">{297}</a></span>
he should risk so great a fall.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_538" id="Ref_538" href="#Foot_538">[538]</a></span>
The two theologians
had no doubt that a war undertaken against the
powerful house of Austria would end in a frightful
catastrophe to the protestants.</p>

<p>When they reached Weimar the two reformers saw
the landgrave, and employed 'their best rhetoric,' says
Luther, to dissuade him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_539" id="Ref_539" href="#Foot_539">[539]</a></span>
The doctor held very
decided opinions on this subject. An alliance with
the King of France, what a disgrace! A war against
the emperor, what madness! 'The devil,' he said,
'desires to govern the nation by making everybody
draw the sword. With what eloquence he strives to
convince us that it is lawful and even necessary!
Somebody is injuring these people, he says; let us
make haste to strike and save them! Madman! God
sleeps not, and is no fool; he knows very well how to
govern the world.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_540" id="Ref_540" href="#Foot_540">[540]</a></span>
We have to contend with an
enemy against whom no human strength or wisdom
can prevail. If we arm ourselves with iron and steel,
with swords and guns, he has only to breathe upon
them, and nothing remains but dust and ashes.... But
if we take upon us the armour of God, the helmet, the
shield, and the sword of the Spirit, then God, if necessary,
will hurl the emperor from his throne,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_541" id="Ref_541" href="#Foot_541">[541]</a></span>
and will keep for us all he has given us—his Gospel, his
kingdom.' Luther and Melanchthon persevered in
their representations to the landgrave, in order to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">{298}</a></span>
thwart Du Bellay's plans. 'This war,' they said,
'will ruin the cause of the Gospel, and fix on it an
indelible stain. Pray do not disturb the peace.' At
these words the prince's face grew red; he did not like
opposition, and gave the two divines an angry answer.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_542" id="Ref_542" href="#Foot_542">[542]</a></span>
'They are people who do not understand the affairs of
this world,' he said; and, returning to Hesse, he pursued
his plans with vigour.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait for success. The King of
France invited the landgrave to cross into Lorraine to
come to an understanding with him: he added, 'without
forgetting to bring Melanchthon.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_543" id="Ref_543" href="#Foot_543">[543]</a></span>
Then Philip
held back no longer: a conference with the mighty
King of France seemed to him of the utmost importance.
He started on his journey, reached Deux-Ponts
on the 18th of January, 1534; and shortly
afterwards that daring prince, who, by quitting Augsburg
in 1530, had thrown the diet into confusion, and
alarmed the cabinet of the emperor,—the most warlike
chief of the evangelical party, the most brilliant
enemy of popery, Philip of Hesse, arrived at Bar-le-Duc,
where Francis received him with the smile
which had not left his lips since his meeting with

<p class="side">=CONFERENCE OF PHILIP AND FRANCIS.=</p>

<p>The two princes first began to scrutinise each other.
The landgrave was thirty years old, and Francis forty.
Philip was short, his eyes large and bold, and his whole
countenance indicated resolution of character. Politics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">{299}</a></span>
and religion immediately occupied their attention.
The king expressed himself strongly in favour of the
ancient liberties of the Germanic empire, which Austria
threatened, and pronounced distinctly for the restoration
of the dukes of Wurtemberg. Coming then to
the grand question, he said, 'Pray explain to me the
state of religious affairs in Germany; I do not quite
understand them.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_545" id="Ref_545" href="#Foot_545">[545]</a></span>
The landgrave explained to
the king, as well as he could, the causes and true
nature of the Reformation, and the struggles to
which it gave rise. Francis I. consented to hear from
the mouth of a prince a statement of those evangelical
principles to which he closed his ears when explained
to him by Zwingle or by Calvin. It is true that Philip
presented them rather in a political light. Francis
showed himself favourable to the protestant princes.
'I refused my consent to a council in Italy,' he
said; 'I desire a neutral city, and instead of an assembly
in which the pope can do what he pleases, I
demand a free council.' 'These are the king's very
words,' wrote the landgrave to the elector.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_546" id="Ref_546" href="#Foot_546">[546]</a></span>
Philip
of Hesse was delighted. Assuredly, if Germany,
France, England, and other states should combine
against the emperor and the pope, all Europe would
be transformed. 'That is not all,' added the landgrave;
'the king told me certain things ... which I am sure
will please your highness.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_547" id="Ref_547" href="#Foot_547">[547]</a></span></p>

<p>The secret conference being ended: 'Now,' said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">{300}</a></span>
Francis to the landgrave, 'pray present Melanchthon
to me.' He had begged the German prince, as we
have seen, to bring this celebrated doctor with him;
the King of France wished for something more than
a diplomatic conference, he desired a religious one.
But the landgrave had not forgotten the interview at
Weimar; and far from inviting Melanchthon, he had
carefully concealed from the Elector of Saxony the
resolution he had formed, notwithstanding his representations,
to unite with the King of France in hostilities
against Austria. Philip having answered that
Melanchthon was not with him: 'Impossible!' exclaimed
the king, and all the French nobles echoed the
word. 'Impossible! you will not make us believe that
Melanchthon is not with you!'—'Everybody wished
to convince us that we had Philip with us,' said the
landgrave.—'Show him to us,' they exclaimed, 'almost
using violence towards us.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_548" id="Ref_548" href="#Foot_548">[548]</a></span></p>

<p>It was indeed a great disappointment. Melanchthon
was the most esteemed representative of the Reformation.
Some of those who accompanied the king had
reckoned upon him for a detailed explanation of the
evangelical principles; there were some even who
desired to consult him on the best means of insuring
their success in France. In their eyes Melanchthon was
as necessary as Philip. 'As he is not here,' said they,
'you must send for him.'—'Really,' said the landgrave,
smiling, 'these Frenchmen desire so much to
see Melanchthon, that, if we could show him to them,
they would give us as much money as Tetzel and all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">{301}</a></span>
the indulgence vendors ever gained with their sanctimonious
paper rubbish.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_549" id="Ref_549" href="#Foot_549">[549]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE TREATY SIGNED.=</p>

<p>They consoled themselves for this disappointment
by holding a new conference on the mode of delivering
Wurtemberg. The king said that he could not
furnish troops, as that would be contrary to the
treaty of Cambray. 'I do not require soldiers,' answered
the landgrave, 'but I want a subsidy.' But
to supply funds for a war against Charles V. was
equally opposed to the treaty. An expedient was
sought and soon found. Duke Ulrich shall sell Montbéliard
to France for 125,000 crowns; but it shall be
stipulated, in a secret article, that if the duke repays
this sum within three years (as he did) Francis will
give back Montbéliard. It would appear that England
also had something to do with the subsidy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_550" id="Ref_550" href="#Foot_550">[550]</a></span>
The treaty was signed on the 27th of January, 1534. It
is worthy of notice that the French historians, even
those free from ultramontane prejudices, do not speak
of this conference.</p>

<p>Several other interviews took place. The landgrave
was not the best type of the true Reformation,
but he had with him some good evangelicals, who, in
their pious zeal, could show the King of France, as
Luther would have done, the way of salvation. Solemn
opportunities are thus given men of leaving the
low grounds in which they live, and rising to the
heights where they will see God. Francis I. closed
his eyes. That prince possessed certain excellent
gifts, but his religion 'was nothing but vanity and
empty show.' At Bar-le-Duc he took the mailed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">{302}</a></span>
hand of the landgrave, but had no desire for the hand
of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The landgrave went back into Germany, and the
King of France to the interior of his states. Returning
from the two interviews, he congratulated himself
on having embraced the pope at Marseilles and
the protestants at Bar-le-Duc. In proportion as the
conference with Clement had been public, that with
Philip had been secret; but, on the other hand, it had
been more confidential and more real. These two
meetings, these two facts in appearance so different,
had been produced by the action of the same law.
That law, which Francis wore in his heart, was hatred
and ruin to Charles V. Were not the pope and the
landgrave two of the princes of Europe who detested
the emperor most? It was therefore quite logical
and in harmony with the science of Machiavelli for
the king to give one hand to Clement and the other
to Philip. Internal contradictions could not fail to
show themselves erelong. In fact, the Landgrave of
Hesse, supported by France, was about to attack
Austria, and establish protestantism in Wurtemberg
in the place of popery.... What would Clement say?
But before we follow the landgrave upon this perilous
enterprise, let us return into France with the
king.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XXXII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">TRIUMPH AND MARTYRDOM.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Winter 1533-34.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="side">=THE GOSPEL IN THE PARIS CHURCHES.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE consequences of the meeting at Marseilles were
to be felt at Paris. After Calvin's flight, the
Queen of Navarre, as we have seen, had succeeded in
calming the storm; and yet the evangelical cause had
never been nearer a violent persecution. The prisons
were soon to be filled; the fires of martyrdom were soon
to be kindled. During the year 1533 <i>Lutheran</i> discourses
had greatly multiplied in the churches. 'Many
notable persons,' says the chronicler, 'were at that
time preaching in the city of Paris.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_551" id="Ref_551" href="#Foot_551">[551]</a></span>
The simplicity,
wisdom, and animation of their language had moved
all who heard them. The churches were filled, not
with formal auditors, but with men who received the
glad-tidings with great joy. 'Drunkards had become
sober; libertines had become chaste; the fruits which
proceeded from the preaching of the Gospel had astonished
the enemies of light and truth.'</p>

<p>The doctors of the Sorbonne did not wait for the
king's orders to attack the evangelicals; his interview
with the pope, and the news of the bull brought from
Rome, had filled the catholic camp with joy. 'What!'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">{304}</a></span>
they exclaimed, 'the king is uniting with the pope at
Marseilles, and in Paris the churches are opened to
heresy! ... let us make haste and close them.'</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Du Bellay, the Bishop of Paris, who
had made such a fine Latin speech to Clement VII., and
who went at heart half-way with his brother, arrived
in the capital. The leaders of the Roman party immediately
surrounded him, urged him, and demanded
the realisation of all the hopes which they had entertained
from the interview at Marseilles. The bishop
was embarrassed, for he knew that his brother and the
king were just then occupied with a very different
matter. Yet it was the desire of Francis that, for
the moment, they should act in conformity with his
apparent and not with his real action. The bishop
gave way. The pious Roussel, the energetic Courault,
the temporising Berthaud, and others besides, were
forbidden to preach, and one morning the worshippers
found the church doors shut.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_552" id="Ref_552" href="#Foot_552">[552]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=PRIVATE MEETINGS.=</p>

<p>Great was their sorrow and agitation. Many went
to Roussel and Courault, and loudly expressed their
regret and their wishes. The ministers took courage,
and 'turned their preaching into private lectures.'
Little meetings were formed in various houses in the
city. At first none but members of the family were
present; but it seemed that Christ, according to his
promise, was in the midst of them, and erelong
friends and neighbours were admitted. The ministers
set forth the promises of Holy Scripture, and the
worshippers exclaimed: 'We receive more blessings
now than before.'</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">{305}</a></div>

<p>There were others besides Parisian faces which
Courault, Roussel, and their friends saw on the humble
benches around their little table: there were persons
from many provinces of France, and even from the
neighbouring countries. Among them was Master
Pointet, a native of Menton, near Annecy, in Savoy,
'who practised the art of surgery in the city of Paris.'
He had been brought to a knowledge of the Gospel in
a singular way. 'Monks and priests,' says the chronicler,
'used to come to him to be cured of the diseases
peculiar to those who substitute an impure celibacy
for the holy institution of marriage.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_553" id="Ref_553" href="#Foot_553">[553]</a></span>
Pointet, observing
that godliness was not to be found among the
priests, sought for it in the Scriptures; and, having discovered
it there, began to remonstrate seriously with
those unhappy men. 'These punishments,' he told
them, 'proceed from your accursed celibacy: they are
your wages, and you would do much better to take a
wife.' Pointet, while reading these severe lessons, loved
to go and learn in the lowly assemblies held by the
humble ministers of the Word of God, and no one listened
with more attention to the preaching of Roussel
and Courault.</p>

<p>The Sorbonnists, having heard of these conventicles,
declared 'that they disliked <i>these lectures</i> still more
than the sermons.' In fact, if the preaching in the
churches had been a loud appeal, the Divine Word in
these small meetings spoke nearer to men's hearts, enlightening
them and making them fast in Jesus Christ;
and accordingly the conversions increased in number.
The lieutenant-criminal once more took the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">{306}</a></span>
field: he posted his agents at the corners of the
more suspected streets, with orders to watch the
Lutherans and ferret them out. These spies discovered
that on certain days and hours many suspicious-looking
persons, most of them poor, were in the
habit of frequenting certain houses. Morin and his
officers set to work immediately: they made the
round of these conventicles, seizing the pastors and
dispersing the flocks. 'We are deprived of everything,'
said the worshippers; 'we remain without
teaching and exhortation. Alas! poor sheep without
shepherds, shall we not go astray and be lost?' Then
with a sudden impulse they exclaimed: 'Since our
guides are taken away from us here, let us seek them
elsewhere!' Many French evangelicals fled into
foreign countries.</p>

<p>While the poor reformed<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_554" id="Ref_554" href="#Foot_554">[554]</a></span>
who remained in Paris
were thus forsaken and sorrowful, the Sorbonne loudly
demanded the return of Beda and the other exiles.
The theologians canvassed the most influential members
of the parliament, and besieged Cardinal Duprat.
The king and the pope had just met solemnly at
Marseilles; one of the Medici had just entered the
family of the Valois; a royal letter, despatched from
Lyons, ordered proceedings to be taken against the
heretics: could they leave the champions of the papacy
in disgrace? The demand was granted, and the impetuous
Beda returned in triumph to the capital with
his friends. That wicked little fairy Catherine had,
unconsciously, and by her mere presence, restored him
to liberty.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">{307}</a></div>

<p class="side">=FRESH EFFORTS OF THE SORBONNE.=</p>

<p>The wrath and fanaticism of Beda, excited by exile,
knew no bounds. The repression of obscure <i>preachers</i>
did not satisfy him; he determined to renew the attack
he had formerly made upon the learned. 'I accuse the
king's readers in the university of Paris,' he said to
the parliament. These were the celebrated professors
Danès, Paul Paradis, Guidacieri, and Vatable, learned
philologists, esteemed by Francis and honoured over
all literary Europe. 'Their interpretations of the
text of Scripture,' continued Beda, 'throw discredit
on the Vulgate, and propagate the errors of Luther.
I demand that they be forbidden to comment on
the Holy Scriptures.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_555" id="Ref_555" href="#Foot_555">[555]</a></span></p>

<p>Beda did not stand alone. Le Picard had returned
from exile with his master, and the Sorbonne, wishing
to give him a striking mark of their esteem, had conferred
on him the degree of doctor of divinity. Beda
and Le Picard took counsel together with some other
priests. War was resolved upon, the legions were
mustered, the plan of the campaign drawn up, and the
various battle-fields allotted among the combatants.
They took possession of the pulpits from which the
preachers of the Reform had been expelled, and loud
voices were heard everywhere giving utterance to
violent harangues against 'the Lutherans.' Beda, Le
Picard, and their followers denounced the heretics as
enemies of the altar and the throne. In the Gospel,
the germ of every liberty, they saw the cause of every
disorder. 'It is not enough to put the Lutheran evangelists
in prison,' said these forerunners of the preachers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">{308}</a></span>
of the League; 'we must go a step further, and burn
them.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_556" id="Ref_556" href="#Foot_556">[556]</a></span></p>

<p>The arrests were begun immediately; but early in
the year 1534 the burning pile was declared to be the
best answer to heresy. The parliament of Paris
published an edict, according to which whoever was
convicted of Lutheranism on the testimony of two
witnesses, should be burnt forthwith.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_557" id="Ref_557" href="#Foot_557">[557]</a></span>
That was
the surest way: the dead never return. Beda immediately
demanded that the decree should be
applied to the four evangelists: Courault, Berthaud,
Roussel, and one of their friends. Notwithstanding
his moderation and his concessions, Roussel
particularly excited the syndic's anger. Was he not
Margaret's chaplain? The terror began to spread.
Whilst Francis at Bar-le-Duc was endeavouring to
please the most decided of the protestants, the evangelicals
of Paris, alarmed by the inquiries of the
police, shut themselves up in their humble dwellings.
'Really,' they said, 'this is not much unlike the
Spanish inquisition.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_558" id="Ref_558" href="#Foot_558">[558]</a></span>
 The Sorbonne dared not,
however, burn Roussel and his friends without the
consent of the king.</p>

<p class="side">=THREE HUNDRED EVANGELICAL PRISONERS.=</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the ultramontane party formed
the design of catching all the Lutherans in Paris in
one cast of the net. Morin set to work: he urged on
his hounds; his sergeants entered the houses, went
down into the cellars and up into the garrets, taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">{309}</a></span>
away, here the husband from the wife; there, the
father from the children; and in another place, the son
from the mother. Some of these poor creatures hid
themselves, others escaped by the roofs; but the chase
was successful upon the whole. The alguazils of the
Sorbonne lodged about <i>three hundred prisoners</i> in the
Conciergerie.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_559" id="Ref_559" href="#Foot_559">[559]</a></span>
When this news spread, with its concomitants
of terror and distress, the flight recommenced
on a larger scale: some were stopped on the road, but
many succeeded in crossing the frontier. Among
their number was a christian courtier, Maurus Musæus,
a gentleman of the king's chamber, who took refuge at
Basle, whence he wrote describing his numerous perplexities
to Bucer.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_560" id="Ref_560" href="#Foot_560">[560]</a></span></p>

<p>All this was done by the Sorbonne and parliament,
as the king had not yet spoken out. At last he
returned to the capital, and everybody thought he
would be eager to fulfil the promises he had made the
pope; but, on the contrary, he hesitated and affected
to be scrupulous. The evil spirit that he had received
from Clement VII. under the form of a Medici, was
too young to have any influence over him. Besides,
he was thinking much more just then of his alliance
with the protestants of Germany than of his union
with the pope, and the attacks made against his professors
in the university annoyed him.</p>

<p>Beda was not discouraged: he got some persons, who
had access to the king, to beg that Roussel and his
friends might be burnt. But how could that prince
send the Lutherans of France to the stake at the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">{310}</a></span>
time he was seeking an alliance with the Lutherans of
Germany? 'Nobody is condemned in France,' he said,
'without being tried. Beda wishes to have Roussel and
his friends burnt; very well! let him first go to the
Conciergerie and reduce them to silence.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_561" id="Ref_561" href="#Foot_561">[561]</a></span>
This was not what Beda wanted: he knew that it was
easier to burn the chaplain than to refute him. But
the king compelled him to go to the prison; and there
the impetuous Beda and the meek Roussel stood face
to face. The disputation began in the presence of
witnesses. The prisoner brought forward, with much
simplicity, the Scriptures of God; the syndic of the
Sorbonne replied with scholastic quibbles and ridiculous
trifling.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_562" id="Ref_562" href="#Foot_562">[562]</a></span>
 His own friends were embarrassed;
everybody saw his ignorance; Beda left the prison
overwhelmed with shame, and Roussel was not burnt.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_563" id="Ref_563" href="#Foot_563">[563]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE KING'S IRRITATION.=</p>

<p>While Beda and Roussel were disputing in the Conciergerie,
a different scene was passing at the Louvre.
A friend of letters, belonging to the royal household,
knowing the king's susceptibility, placed a little book
elegantly bound on a table near which the king was
accustomed to sit. Francis approached, took up the
book heedlessly, and looked at it. He was greatly surprised
on reading the title: <i>Remonstrance addressed to
the King of France by the three doctors of Paris, banished
and relegated, praying to be recalled from their exile</i>.
It was a work published by Beda before his return
to Paris, and had been carefully concealed from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">{311}</a></span>
monarch. 'Ho! ho!' said he, 'this book is addressed
to me!' He opened and read, and great was his anger
on seeing how he was insulted and slandered....
'Francis I. regards neither pope nor Medici: in his
eyes, the chief infallibility is always his own.' 'Send
those wretches to prison,' he exclaimed; and immediately
Beda, Le Picard, and Le Clerq were shut up
in the bishop's prison on a charge of high treason.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_564" id="Ref_564" href="#Foot_564">[564]</a></span></p>

<p>And now the chiefs of both causes were in confinement:
Gerard Roussel, Courault, and Berthaud on
one side; Beda, Le Picard, and Le Clerq on the other.
Would any one dare affirm that the King of France
did not hold the balance even between the two schools?
Who shall be released? who shall remain a prisoner?
was now the question. It would have been better to
set them all at large; but neither Francis nor his
age had attained to religious liberty. Contrary winds
agitated that prince, and drove him by turns towards
Rome and towards Wittemberg. One or other of
them, however, must prevail. Margaret, believing
the time to be critical, displayed indefatigable activity.
She pleaded the cause of her friends to the king and
to his ministers. Still mistaken, or seeming to be
mistaken, as regards Montmorency, she begged this
treacherous friend to save the very persons whose destruction
he had sworn. 'Dear nephew,' she wrote to
him, 'they are just now completing the proceedings
against Master Gerard, and I hope the king will find him
worthy of something better than the stake, and that he
has never held any opinion deserving such punishment,
or savouring of heresy. I have known him these five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">{312}</a></span>
years, and, believe me, if I had seen anything doubtful
in him, I should not so long have put up with
such a pagan.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_565" id="Ref_565" href="#Foot_565">[565]</a></span>
The king could not resist his sister's
earnest solicitations and the desire of making friends
among the protestants of Germany. In the month of
March 1534 he published an ordinance vindicating
the evangelical preachers from the calumnies of the
theologians, and setting them at liberty.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_566" id="Ref_566" href="#Foot_566">[566]</a></span></p>

<p>Surprising thing! Roussel, Courault, and Berthaud
at liberty; Beda, Le Picard, and Le Clerq in prison!
The champions of heresy triumph, and the champions
of the Church are in chains! And this, too, after the
king's return from Marseilles (the interview at Bar-le-Duc
was not known at Paris), and four months after
the marriage of Henry of France with the pope's
niece!... Where are the promises made to Clement VII.?
Both the city and the Sorbonne were
deeply excited by this measure.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_567" id="Ref_567" href="#Foot_567">[567]</a></span>
The greater the
hopes aroused by the union with the papacy, the greater
the fears caused by the king's conduct towards its
most intrepid defenders. Would Francis I. become a
Henry VIII.? Would Roman catholicism be ruined
in France? The priests were afraid—many of them
even despaired.</p>

<p>The evangelicals, on the contrary, were delighted.
The Word of God was about to triumph, they thought,
not only in Paris, but also throughout France. Surprising
news indeed came from Lyons, where an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">{313}</a></span>
invisible preacher kept the whole population in
suspense.</p>

<p class="side">=ALEXANDER AT GENEVA.=</p>

<p>The friar De la Croix, whom we have already
mentioned, having abandoned Paris, his convent, his
cowl, and his monkish title, had reached Geneva under
the name of Alexander. Cordially welcomed by Farel
and Froment, he had been instructed by their care in
the knowledge of the truth. His transformation had
been complete. Christ had become to him 'the sun
of righteousness; he had a burning zeal to know him,
and great boldness in confessing him. Incontinent,
he showed himself resolute, and resisted all gainsayers.'
Accordingly the Genevan magistracy, which was under
the influence of the priests, had condemned him to
death as a heretic; the sentence had, however, been
commuted, 'for fear of the King of France,' who would
not suffer a Frenchman, even if heretical, to be maltreated,
and Alexander was simply turned out of the
city. When on the high-road beyond the gates, and
near the Mint, he stopped and preached to the people
who had followed him. Such was the power of his
language that it inspired respect in all around him.
'Nobody could stop him,' says Froment, 'so strongly
did his zeal impel him to win people to the Lord.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_568" id="Ref_568" href="#Foot_568">[568]</a></span></p>

<p>Alexander first went to Berne with Froment, and
then, retracing his steps, seriously reflected whether he
ought not to return into France. He did not deceive
himself: persecution, imprisonment, death, awaited him
there. Then ought he not rather, like so many others,
to preach the Gospel in Switzerland? But France
had so much need of the light and grace of God....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">{314}</a></span>
should he abandon her? To preach Christ to his countrymen,
Alexander was ready to bear all manner of
evil, and even death. One single passion swallowed
up all others. 'O my Saviour! thou hast given thy
life for me; I desire to give mine for thee!' He crossed
the frontier; and, learning that Bresse and Maconnais
(Saône-et-Loire), where Michael d'Aranda had preached
Christ in 1524, were without evangelists, he began to
proclaim the forgiveness of the Gospel to the simple and
warm-hearted people of that district, among whom fanaticism
had so many adherents. He did not mind this:
wandering along the banks of the Bienne, the Ain, the
Seille, and the Saône, he entered the cottages of the
poor peasants, and courageously scattered the seed of
the Gospel.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_569" id="Ref_569" href="#Foot_569">[569]</a></span>
A rumour of his doings reached Lyons,
where certain pious goldsmiths, always ready to make
sacrifices for their faith, invited Alexander to come
and preach in their city.</p>

<p class="side">=HIS WORK AT LYONS.=</p>

<p>It was a wider field than the plains of Bresse.
Alexander departed, arrived at Lyons, and entered the
goldsmiths' shops. He conversed with them, and
made the acquaintance of several <i>poor men of Lyons</i>,
who were rich in faith; they edified one another, but
this did not satisfy him. The living faith by which he
was animated gave him an indefatigable activity. He
was prompt in his decisions, full of spirit in his addresses,
ingenious in his plans. He began to preach
from house to house; next 'he got a number of people
together here and there, and preached before them, to
the great advancement of the Word.' Opposition soon
began to show itself, and Alexander exclaimed: 'Oh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">{315}</a></span>
that Lyons were a free city like Geneva!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_570" id="Ref_570" href="#Foot_570">[570]</a></span>
Those who
desired to hear the Word grew more thirsty every
day; they went to Alexander, and conversed with him;
they dragged him to their houses, but the evangelist
could not supply all their wants. He wrote to Farel,
asking for help from Geneva, but none came; the persecution
was believed to be so fierce at Lyons, that nobody
dared expose himself to it. Alexander continued,
therefore, to preach alone, sometimes in by-streets,
and sometimes in an upper chamber. The priests
and their creatures, always on the watch, endeavoured
to seize him, but the evangelist had hardly finished
his sermon when the faithful, who loved him devotedly,
surrounded him, carried him away, and
conducted him to some hiding-place. But Alexander
did not remain there long: wistfully putting out
his head, and looking round the house, to see that
there was no one on the watch, he came forth to go
and preach at the other extremity of the city. He
had hardly finished when he was carried away again,
and the believers took him to some new retreat, 'hiding
him from one house to another,' says the chronicler,
'so that he could not be found.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_571" id="Ref_571" href="#Foot_571">[571]</a></span>
The evangelist
was everywhere and nowhere. When the priests were
looking after him in some suburb in the south, he was
preaching in the north, on the heights which overlook
the city. He put himself boldly in the van, he proclaimed
the Gospel loudly, and yet he was invisible.</p>

<p>Alexander did more than this: he even visited the
prisons. He heard one day that two men, well known
in Geneva, who had come to Lyons on business, had
been thrown into the bishop's dungeons on the information
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">{316}</a></span>
of the Genevan priests: they were the energetic
Baudichon de la Maison-Neuve, and his friend
Cologny.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_572" id="Ref_572" href="#Foot_572">[572]</a></span>
The gates opened for Alexander: he entered,
and that mysterious evangelist, who baffled the
police of Lyons, was inside the episcopal prison. If one
of the agents who are in search of him should recognise
him, the gates will never open again for him. But
Alexander felt no uneasiness; he spoke to the two
Genevans, and exhorted them; he even went and
consoled other brethren imprisoned for the Gospel,
and then left the dungeons, no man laying a hand
on him. The priests and their agents, bursting with
vexation at seeing the futility of all their efforts,
met and lamented with one another. 'There is a
Lutheran,' they said, 'who preaches and disturbs the
people, collecting assemblies here and there in the city,
whom we must catch, for he will spoil all the world, as
everybody is running after him; and yet we cannot
find him, or know who he is.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_573" id="Ref_573" href="#Foot_573">[573]</a></span>
They increased their
exertions, but all was useless. Never had preacher
in so extraordinary a manner escaped so many snares.
At last they began to say that the unknown preacher
must be possessed of satanic powers, by means of
which he passed invisible through the police, and no
one suspected his presence.</p>

<p class="side">=MARGARET AND ROUSSEL.=</p>

<p>Thus the Gospel was proclaimed in the first and in
the second city of France. The Sorbonne and the
catholic party had been intimidated by the king, and
the Easter festival of 1534, which was approaching,
might give the evangelicals of Paris a striking opportunity
of proclaiming their faith. This was what the
Queen of Navarre desired. She had passed some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">{317}</a></span>
time at Alençon, and also at Argentan, not far from
Caen, with her sister-in-law, Catherine d'Albret, abbess
of the convent of the Holy Trinity; at length
she had returned to Paris. The priests dared not name
her, but they made certain allusions to her in their
sermons which their hearers very well understood.
These things were reported to Margaret, who cared
neither to pacify nor to punish her accusers, and
answered them only by endeavouring still more to
advance the cause of piety in France. The little
conventicles only half pleased her: she wanted the
evangelical doctrine to enter the kingdom by the
churches, and not by the 'upper chambers.' She
would have desired for France a reformation similar
to that of England, which, while giving it the Word
of God, preserved its archbishops and bishops, its
cathedrals, its liturgy, and its grandeur. Queen of
France, she would have been its Elizabeth; but
doubtless with more grace. Her ambition was to
install the Gospel at Notre Dame. She paid a visit
to the king; she spoke to the bishop ... Roussel
shall preach there. He was not a Farel in boldness,
but Margaret encouraged him; besides, the idea of
preaching the Gospel to the people of Paris in that
old cathedral was pleasing to him. He determined,
therefore, to comply with the queen's wishes.</p>

<p>The report of Margaret's intentions had hardly
become known, when the canons were in commotion.
How scandalous! What! shall these evangelicals, of
whom they wished to purge France, assemble in
the cathedral?... A disciple of Luther ... in the
temple ennobled by so many holy bishops!...
Finding themselves betrayed by the king, the priests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">{318}</a></span>
resolved to turn to the people. These fanatics did not
scruple to become mob-leaders; they traversed the city
and the suburbs, entered the shops, distributed little
handbills, and stuck up placards: under the excitement
of this mission the oldest Sorbonnists regained all
the activity of youth. 'We must resist these scandalous
meetings at any cost,' they said. 'Let the people
crowd before the gates of Notre Dame, and hinder the
evangelicals from entering; or, if they do not succeed,
let them fill the cathedral, and prevent Roussel from
ascending the pulpit, and drown his heretical voice by
the shouts of the believers.' When the day came, a
great movement took place among the citizens of Paris.
An immense crowd hastened from all the neighbouring
quarters, who surrounded Notre Dame and filled the
interior of the church. The Lutherans could not get
in, and Roussel was forced to give up his sermon.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_574" id="Ref_574" href="#Foot_574">[574]</a></span></p>

<p>A favourable wind seemed generally to be breathing
over the Reformation: its enemies were still in
prison and its friends at liberty; Francis appeared
to be more than ever in harmony with his sister and
with the protestants of Germany; and an evangelical
orator was authorised to preach at Notre Dame: a
violent hurricane, however, suddenly burst upon the
metropolis. A pious and active christian was there
to lose his life, and Paris was to witness at the same
time—a triumph and a martyrdom.</p>

<p class="side">=ALEXANDER AT LYONS.=</p>

<p>One day, a few weeks after Easter, a man loaded
with chains entered the capital: he was escorted by
archers, all of whom showed him much respect. They
took him to the Conciergerie. It was Alexander
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">{319}</a></span>
Canus, known among the Dominicans by the name
of Father Laurent de la Croix. At Lyons, as at
Paris, Easter had been the time appointed by the
evangelicals for boldly raising their banner. The
goldsmiths, who were to Alexander what the Queen
of Navarre was to Roussel, were no longer satisfied
with preachings in secret. Every preparation was
made for a great assembly; the locality was settled;
pious christians went through the streets from house
to house and gave notice of the time and place. Many
were attracted by the desire of hearing a doctrine that
was so much talked about, and on Easter-day the ex-dominican
preached before a large audience.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_575" id="Ref_575" href="#Foot_575">[575]</a></span>
Was it in a church, in some hall, or in the open air? The
chronicler does not say. Alexander moved his hearers
deeply, and it might have been said that Christ rose
again that Easter morn in Lyons, where he had so long
lain in the sepulchre. All were not, however, equally
friendly; some cast sinister glances. Alexander was
no longer invisible: the spies in the assembly saw him,
heard him, studied his physiognomy, took note of his
<i>blasphemies</i>, and hurried off to report them to their
superiors.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_576" id="Ref_576" href="#Foot_576">[576]</a></span></p>

<p>While the police were listening to the reports and
taking their measures, there were voices of joy and
deliverance in many a humble dwelling. A divine
call had been heard, and many were resolved to obey
it. Alexander, who had belonged to the order of
<i>Preachers</i>, combined the gift of eloquence with the
sincerest piety. Accordingly, his hearers requested
him to preach again the second day of Easter. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">{320}</a></span>
meeting took place on Monday, and was more numerous
than the day before. All eyes were fixed on
the evangelist, all ears were attentive, all faces were
beaming with joy; here and there, however, a few
countenances of evil omen might be seen: they were
the agents charged to seize the mysterious preacher.
The assembly heard a most touching discourse; but
just when Alexander's friends desired, as usual, to
surround him and get him away, the officers of justice,
more expeditious this time, came forward, laid their
hands upon him, and took him to prison. He was
brought before the tribunal and condemned to death.
This cruel sentence distressed all the evangelicals,
who urged him to appeal; he did appeal, which had
the effect of causing him to be transferred to Paris.
'That was not done without great mystery,' says
Froment, 'and without the great providence of God.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_577" id="Ref_577" href="#Foot_577">[577]</a></span>
People said to one another that Paul, having appealed
to the emperor, won over a great nation at Rome; and
they asked whether Alexander might not do the same
at Paris. The evangelist departed under the escort
of a captain and his company.</p>

<p>The captain was a worthy man: he rode beside
Alexander, and they soon entered into conversation.
The officer questioned him, and the ex-dominican
explained to him the cause of his arrest. The soldier
listened with astonishment; he took an interest in the
story, and by degrees the words of the pious prisoner
entered into his heart. He heard God's call and awoke;
he experienced a few moments of struggle and doubt,
but erelong the assurance of faith prevailed. 'The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">{321}</a></span>
captain was converted,' says Froment, 'while taking
him to Paris.' Alexander did not stop at this; he
spoke to each of the guards, and some of them also
were won over to the Gospel. The first evening they
halted at an inn, and the prisoner found means to
address a few good words to the servants and the
heads of the household. This was repeated every day.
People came to see the strange captive, they entered
into conversation with him, and he answered every
question. He employed in the service of the Gospel
all the skill that he possessed in discussion. 'He was
learned in the doctrine of the sophists,' says a contemporary,
'having profited well and studied long at
Paris with his companions (the Dominicans).' Now
and then the people went and fetched the priest or
orator of the village to dispute with him; but they
were easily reduced to silence. Many of the hearers
were enlightened and touched, and some were converted.
They said, as they left the inn: 'Really we
have never seen a man answer and confound his adversaries
better by Holy Scripture.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_578" id="Ref_578" href="#Foot_578">[578]</a></span>
The crowd increased
from town to town. At last Alexander arrived
in Paris: 'Wonderful thing!' remarks the chronicler,
'he was more useful at the inns and on the road than
he had ever been before.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_579" id="Ref_579" href="#Foot_579">[579]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=A PRISONER IN PARIS.=</p>

<p>This remarkable prisoner was soon talked of in many
quarters of Paris. The case was a very serious
one. 'A friar, a Dominican, an inquisitor,' said the
people, 'has gone over to the Lutherans, and is striving
to make heretics everywhere.' The monks of his
own convent made the most noise. The king, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">{322}</a></span>
detained Beda in prison, desired to preserve the
balance by giving some satisfaction to the catholics.
He was not uneasy about the German protestants; he
had observed closely the landgrave's ardour, and had
no fear that the fiery Philip would break off the
alliance for a Dominican monk. Francis, therefore,
allowed matters to take their course, and Alexander
appeared before a court of parliament. 'Name your
accomplices,' said the judges; and as he refused to
name the accomplices, who did not exist, the president
added: 'Give him the boot.' The executioners brought
forward the boards and the wedges, with which they
tightly compressed the legs of the evangelist. His
sufferings soon became so severe that, hoping they
had converted him, they stopped the torture, and the
president once more called upon him to name all who,
like himself, had separated from the Church of Rome;
but he was not to be shaken, and the punishment
began again. 'He was severely tortured several
times,' say the <i>Actes</i>, 'to great extremity of cruelty.'
The executioners drove the wedges so tightly between
the boards in which his limbs were confined, that
his left leg was crushed. Alexander groaned aloud:
'O God!' he exclaimed, 'there is neither pity nor
mercy in these men! ... oh that I may find both in
thee!'—'Keep on,' said the head executioner. The
unhappy man, who had observed Budæus among the
assessors, turned on him a mild look of supplication,
and said: 'Is there no Gamaliel here to moderate the
cruelty they are practising on me?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_580" id="Ref_580" href="#Foot_580">[580]</a></span>
The illustrious
scholar, an honest and just man, although irresolute in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">{323}</a></span>
his proceedings, kept his eyes fixed on the martyr,
astonished at his patience. 'It is enough,' he said:
'he has been tortured too much; you ought to be
satisfied.' Budæus was a person of great authority;
his words took effect, and the <i>extraordinary gehenna</i>
ceased. 'The executioners lifted up the martyr, and
carried him to his dungeon a cripple.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_581" id="Ref_581" href="#Foot_581">[581]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=ALEXANDER TORTURED.=</p>

<p>It was the custom to deliver sentence in the absence
of the accused, and to inform him of it in the Conciergerie
through a clerk of the criminal office. The idea
occurred of pronouncing it in Alexander's presence;
perhaps in his terror he might ask for some alleviation,
and by this means they might extort a confession.
But all was useless. The court made a great display,
and a crowd of spectators increased the solemnity,
to no purpose: Alexander Canus, of Evreux, in Normandy,
was condemned to be burnt alive. A flash
of joy suddenly lit up his face. 'Truly,' said the
spectators, 'is he more joyful than he was before!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_582" id="Ref_582" href="#Foot_582">[582]</a></span></p>

<p>The priests now came forward to perform the sacerdotal
degradation. 'If you utter a word,' they told
him, 'you will have your tongue cut out.'—'The
practice of cutting off the tongue,' adds the historian,
'began that year.' The priests took off his sacerdotal
dress, shaved his head, and went through all the <i>usual
mysteries</i>. During this ceremony Alexander uttered
not a word; only at one of the absurdities of the priests
he let a smile escape him. They dressed him in the
<i>robe de fol</i>—a garment of coarse cloth, such as was
worn by the poorer peasantry. When the pious
martyr caught sight of it, he exclaimed, 'O God, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">{324}</a></span>
there any greater honour than to receive this day
the livery which thy Son received in the house of
Herod?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_583" id="Ref_583" href="#Foot_583">[583]</a></span></p>

<p>A cart, generally used to carry mud or dust, was
brought to the front of the building. Some Dominicans,
his former brethren, got into it along with the humble
christian, and all proceeded towards the Place Maubert.
As the cart moved but slowly, Alexander, standing up,
leant over towards the people, and 'scattered the seed
of the Gospel with both hands.' Many persons, moved
even to tears, exclaimed that they were putting him
to death wrongfully; but the Dominicans pulled him
by his gown, and annoyed him in every way. At
first he paid no attention to this; but when one of the
monks said to him coarsely: 'Either recant, or hold
your tongue,' Alexander turned round and said to
him with firmness: 'I will not renounce Jesus Christ....
Depart from me, ye deceivers of the people!'</p>

<p>At last they reached the front of the scaffold.
While the executioners were making the final preparations,
Alexander, observing some lords and ladies in
the crowd, with common people, monks, and several of
his friends, asked permission to address a few words
to them. An ecclesiastical dignitary, a chanter of the
Sainte Chapelle, carrying a long staff, presided over
the clerical part of the ceremony, and he gave his
consent. Then, seized with a holy enthusiasm, Alexander
confessed, 'with great vehemence and vivacity
of mind,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_584" id="Ref_584" href="#Foot_584">[584]</a></span>
the Saviour whom he loved so much, and
for whom he was condemned to die. 'Yes,' he exclaimed,
'Jesus, our only Redeemer, suffered death to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">{325}</a></span>
ransom us to God his Father. I have said it, and
I say it again, O ye christians who stand around me,
pray to God that, as his son Jesus Christ died for me,
he will give me grace to die now for him.'</p>

<p class="side">=ALEXANDER'S TRIUMPHANT DEATH.=</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, he said to the executioner:
'Proceed.' The officers of justice approached, they
bound him to the pile and set it on fire. The wood
crackled, the flames rose, and Alexander, his eyes upraised
to heaven, exclaimed: 'O Jesus Christ, have
pity on me! O Saviour, receive my soul!' He saw
the glory of God; by faith he discerned Jesus in
heaven, who received him into his kingdom. 'My
Redeemer!' he repeated, 'O my Redeemer!' At last
his voice was silent. The people wept; the executioners
said to one another: 'What a strange criminal!'
and even the monks asked: 'If this man is not
saved, who will be?' Many beat their breasts, and
said: 'A great wrong has been done to that man!'
And as the spectators separated, they went away
thinking: 'It is wonderful how these people suffer
themselves to be burnt in defence of their faith.'<span

<p>The Romish party having obtained this satisfaction,
the political party thought only of overthrowing popery
in one of the states of Germany, and of paving the
way for its decline in the kingdom of St. Louis.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">WURTEMBERG GIVEN TO PROTESTANTISM BY THE KING OF FRANCE.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Spring 1534.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE idea of correcting the errors of the Church
without changing its government was not new
in France. By the Pragmatic Sanction in 1269,
St. Louis had founded the liberties of the Gallican
Church; and the great idea of reform had been widely
spread since the time of the council of Constance
(1414), of Clemengis, and of Gerson. The two Du
Bellays, with many priests, scholars, and noblemen,
thought it was the only means of calming down the
agitations of christendom, and Margaret of Valois had
made it the great business of her life.</p>

<p class="side">=INTERVIEW OF DU BELLAY AND BUCER.=</p>

<p>William du Bellay, on his way back from Augsburg,
where he had delivered such noble speeches
in favour of the protestant dukes of Wurtemberg,
had stopped at Strasburg, and had several meetings
with the pacific Bucer. His success in Germany, his
conversations with the evangelical princes and doctors,
who took him for as sound a protestant as themselves,
had filled him with hope. In no place could those
who desired to take a middle course meet with
more sympathy than at Strasburg; there was quite a
system of compromises there with the Swiss and with
Luther; why not with Rome also? 'Since Luther
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">{327}</a></span>
will not give way in anything,' Bucer had said, 'I will
accommodate myself to his terminology; only I will
avoid every expression that may indicate a too local
and too gross presence of the body of Christ in the
bread.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_586" id="Ref_586" href="#Foot_586">[586]</a></span>
Accordingly Bucer, with his pious and
moderate friends Capito, Hedio, and Zell, received
the diplomatic mediator with great pleasure. They
retired to the reformer's library, where Du Bellay
explained his great project with all the seriousness of
a man convinced. 'It is a greater work,' he said to
Bucer, 'than this union of Zwinglians and Lutherans
which has hitherto been your sole and constant occupation.
We wish to effect a fusion between catholicism
and the Reformation. We shall maintain the <i>unity</i> of
the former; we shall uphold the <i>truth</i> of the latter.'
Du Bellay's plan was at bottom, we see, the same as
Leibnitz endeavoured to get Bossuet and Louis XIV.
to accept. Bucer was in ecstasies: it was what he had
sought so long; the diplomatist appeared to him as if
surrounded with a halo of glory. And hence he often
said: 'If the Lord would raise up many men like this
<i>hero</i>, the kingdom of Christ would soon come out of
the pit.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_587" id="Ref_587" href="#Foot_587">[587]</a></span>
According to Bucer, Du Bellay was meditating
a very perilous but still a great enterprise: it was
a labour worthy of Hercules.... The counsellor of the
King of France was satisfied to find the great pacificator
agreeing with him, and hastened to Paris, flattering
himself that he would gain a victory more striking
than that of Francis I. at Marignan, or of Charles V.
at Pavia.</p>

<p>Everything seemed favourable: Francis, delighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">{328}</a></span>
at his conference with the landgrave, had never been
better disposed for conciliation. Du Bellay endeavoured
to convince him that Germany was quite ready for
the <i>great fusion</i>. Melanchthon, whom all Germany
venerated, was (in his opinion) the man of the hour,
by whose agency the two contrary currents would
mingle their waters and form but one stream bearing
life to every part. Was it not he who said: 'Preserve
all the old ceremonies that you can: every innovation
is injurious to the people?' Had he not declared at
Augsburg that no doctrine separated him from the
Roman Church; that he respected the universal
authority of the pope, and desired to remain faithful
to Christ and the Church of Rome? Margaret
of Navarre also spoke to her brother of this great and
good man: 'Melanchthon's mildness,' she said, 'contrasts
with the violent temper of Zwingle and Luther.'
Other persons observed to the king that what distinguished
France from all catholic nations was its attachment
to those liberties of the Church, which were
on that account denominated <i>Gallican</i>. 'It would
thus be a thoroughly French enterprise,' they said, 'to
strip the pope of his usurped privileges.'</p>

<p>Francis listened. To be king both in Church and
State, to imitate his dear brother of England, who at
heart was more catholic than himself,—this was his
desire. Du Bellay, noticing this disposition, laboured
vehemently (to use his own expression)<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_588" id="Ref_588" href="#Foot_588">[588]</a></span>
to introduce
the Melanchthonian ideas into France. He spoke of
them at court and in the city, sometimes even to the
clergy, and met everywhere with almost universal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">{329}</a></span>
approbation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_589" id="Ref_589" href="#Foot_589">[589]</a></span>
'Only make a forward movement,' he
was told. The king resumed the reading of the Bible,
which he had laid aside after the first days of the
Reformation. It was not that he relished the Word of
God, but the Bible was a weapon that would help him
to gain the victory over the emperor. When conversing
with the persons around him, he would quote
some phrase of Scripture. He particularly liked the
passages where St. Paul speaks of <i>breastplates</i>, <i>shields</i>,
<i>helmets</i>, and <i>swords</i>. He found the apostle, indeed, a
little too spiritual and mystical; and in his heart he
preferred the helmet of a soldier to the <i>helmet of
salvation</i>; but he appeared every day better disposed
towards the Holy Scriptures.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_590" id="Ref_590" href="#Foot_590">[590]</a></span>
Margaret was
transported with joy. 'I agree with the German
protestants,' said the king to Du Bellay. 'Yes, I
agree with them in <i>all</i> points ... except <i>one</i>!' Du
Bellay wrote immediately to Bucer, and added: 'You
know what that means.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_591" id="Ref_591" href="#Foot_591">[591]</a></span>
Francis desired to remain
in union with Rome for form's sake, if it were only
by a thread. But Rome is not contented with a
thread.</p>

<p class="side">=FRANCIS COOPERATES WITH THEM.=</p>

<p>An approaching event seemed destined to decide
whether or not a semi-reformation would be established
in France. The king and his minister kept
their eyes fixed on Germany, and waited impatiently
to learn if the enterprise decided upon at Bar-le-Duc
for the restoration of the protestant princes to the
throne of Wurtemberg would be crowned with success.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">{330}</a></span>
In their eyes Wurtemberg was the field of battle where
the cause of the papacy would triumph or be crushed.
Francis hoped that, if the protestants were victorious,
they would enter upon a war that would become
general. If the empire and the papacy fell beneath
the blows of their enemies, new times would begin.
Europe would be emancipated from both pope and
emperor, and Francis would profit largely, both for
himself and France, by this glorious emancipation.</p>

<p>The landgrave prepared everything for the great
blow he was about to strike. At once prudent and
active, he did not write a word that could compromise
him, but sent his confidential counsellors in every
direction. He went in person to the Elector of
Trèves and the elector-palatine, and promised them
that if Wurtemberg was restored to its lawful princes,
Charles's brother should be compensated by being
recognised King of the Romans. These measures
succeeded with Philip, who immediately made known
this happy commencement to Francis I.</p>

<p>On Easter Monday (1534) the Louvre displayed all
its magnificence; many officers of the court were on
foot, for Francis was to give audience to the agent of
the Waywode (hospodar) of Wallachia, who had been
dispossessed by Austria, like the Duke of Wurtemberg.
The king's eyes sparkled with delight: 'The
Swabian league is dissolved,' he told the envoy. 'I
am sending money into Germany.... I have many
friends there.... My allies are already in arms.... We
are on the point of carrying our plan into execution.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_592" id="Ref_592" href="#Foot_592">[592]</a></span>
Francis was so happy that he could not keep
his secret.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">{331}</a></div>

<p class="side">=FEARS IN GERMANY.=</p>

<p>All was not, however, so near as he imagined. An
old obstacle came up again, and seemed as if it would
check the landgrave. The other evangelical princes
and doctors did all they could to thwart an enterprise
which would, in Philip's opinion, secure their triumph.
'The restoration of the Duke of Wurtemberg,' said
the wise Melanchthon, 'will engender great troubles.
Even the Church will be endangered by them. You
know my forebodings.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_593" id="Ref_593" href="#Foot_593">[593]</a></span>
All the kings of Europe
will be mixed up in this war. It is a matter full of
peril, not only to ourselves, but to the whole world.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_594" id="Ref_594" href="#Foot_594">[594]</a></span>
Astrology interfered in the matter, and spread terror
among the people. Lichtenberg, a famous astrologer,
published some predictions, to which he added certain
'monstrous pictures,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_595" id="Ref_595" href="#Foot_595">[595]</a></span>
 and said: 'The Frenchman
(Francis) will again fall into the emperor's hands;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_596" id="Ref_596" href="#Foot_596">[596]</a></span>
and all who unite with him in making war will be
destroyed. The lion will want help, and will be
deceived by the lily.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_597" id="Ref_597" href="#Foot_597">[597]</a></span>
In such terms the German
prophecy declared that France (the lily) would deceive
Hesse (whose device is a lion): this shows how
little confidence Germany had in the French monarch.</p>

<p>Ferdinand of Austria distrusted the prophecy, and
thought the landgrave's attack close at hand. Sensible
of his own weakness, he turned to the pope and said
to him through his envoy Sanchez: 'The landgrave's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">{332}</a></span>
expedition is a danger which threatens the Church
and Italy ... the spirituality and the temporality.'
The pope promised everything, but (as was his
custom) with the determination to do nothing. A
war that might weaken Charles was gratifying to him,
even though protestantism should profit by it. Clement,
however, convoked the consistory; described
to them in very expressive language the danger of the
empire and the Church; but of helping them, not a
word.... Ferdinand, still more alarmed, became more
importunate, and the matter was brought before a
congregation: 'Alas!' said Clement to the cardinals,
'it is impossible to conceal from you the dangers that
threaten King Ferdinand and the Austrian power.
They are attacked by so severe a disease that a simple
medicine would be insufficient to effect a cure.... It
requires an energetic remedy ... but where can it be
found?' The cardinals agreed with their chief; they
thought that, as the danger threatened Austria alone,
it was for Austria to get out of it as she could. The
recollection of the sack of Rome by the imperialists
in 1527 was not yet effaced from the hearts of these
Roman priests, and they were not sorry to see the
emperor punished by an heretical scourge. They
resolved that as Rome could not give a subsidy sufficiently
large, they would give none at all. 'This
expedition,' said Clement VII. to Ferdinand's envoy,
with a certain frankness, 'is only a private matter....
But if the landgrave touches the Church, you may
reckon then upon my help.' Sanchez, seeing the
pontiff's lukewarmness, and moved by sorrow and
indignation,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_598" id="Ref_598" href="#Foot_598">[598]</a></span>
forcibly replied: 'Be not deceived,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">{333}</a></span>
holy father.... This matter is not so small as you
suppose.... It will cost the Church of Rome dear ...
and not the Church only, but the city and all
Italy.'</p>

<p class="side">=THE POPE AND AUSTRIA.=</p>

<p>Sanchez thought, like Francis and the politicians,
that the protestants, victorious in Wurtemberg, would
not stop in so glorious a career; that they would raise
a large army; and that, aided by France, they would
cross the Alps and go to Rome to dethrone the successor
of St. Peter, and put an end to what they
regarded as the power of antichrist. This suggestion
exasperated Clement: he felt the tiara shaking on his
head, and angrily exclaimed: 'And where is the
emperor? What is he doing? Why does he not
watch over his brother's states and the peace of
Germany?' Charles V., quite unconcerned about
a project which might, however, insure his rival's
triumph, was calmly enjoying his repose beneath the
smiling sky of Spain, reclining on the banks of its
beautiful rivers, under the shade of its orange and
citron trees and of its gigantic laurels. The pope took
courage from his example to do the same. If he did
nothing to stop the protestant army, the papacy might
suffer; but if he did anything, he might turn aside
from the house of Austria the terrible blow about to
fall on it, and save from a reverse that imperial
power which he detested. The pontiff sank back
into his apostolic chair, and prepared for a luxurious
slumber, thinking it would be time enough to wake
up ... when danger was at his own door. 'Alas!'
said sincere catholics, 'why are the successors of
St. Peter, the fisherman and apostle, <i>clothed in soft
raiment</i>, which is for those who are <i>in kings' houses</i>?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">{334}</a></span>
Why do they covet these courtly pomps and effeminacies?
Why do they imitate <i>the princes of the Gentiles
who exercise dominion over them</i>? Christ bore the
cross.' The political passions of Clement VII. extinguished
his ecclesiastical zeal. The temporal power
of the popes has never been other than a clog upon
their spiritual power, preventing it from working
freely. The judgments of God were about to be
executed.</p>

<p>At the beginning of May everything was astir
in Hesse, Pomerania, Mecklenburg, Brunswick, Westphalia,
and on the banks of the Rhine; the landgrave
was preparing to march against Austria. Omens
threatened, indeed, to detain him. At Cassel, the
chief town of Hesse, a monster was seen walking
mysteriously and silently upon the water during the
night.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_599" id="Ref_599" href="#Foot_599">[599]</a></span>
'It is a sure warning,' said the old crones and
a few citizens, 'that the prince ought to stop.' But
Philip replied coldly: 'These visions are not worthy
of belief.' Without heeding the monster, Philip,
mounted on horseback and carrying a lance in his
hand, reviewed his army on Wednesday, the 6th of
May, after midnight, and then gave the order to march.
Almost all the officers and a great many of the soldiers
belonged to the evangelical confession. It was, alas!
the first politico-religious army of the sixteenth century,
and this campaign was the first Germanico-European
opposition to the house of Austria.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_600" id="Ref_600" href="#Foot_600">[600]</a></span>
History
shrouds herself beneath a veil of mourning as she points
to this epoch; for the employment of human force in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">{335}</a></span>
the interests of religion, the armed struggle between
the new and the old times, began then.</p>

<p class="side">=PHILIP DEFEATS THE AUSTRIAN.=</p>

<p>The Austrian government, deserted by the pope,
saw that it must help itself, and had made great exertions
on its part. All the convents, chapters, and
towns of Wurtemberg had been forced to contribute
large sums of money, and the most experienced
generals of the Italian wars had been placed at the
head of the imperial army. The soldiers of Austria
marched to Laufen on the Neckar, and there waited
for the enemy. The landgrave's army, full of hope
and courage, uttered loud shouts of joy when they
heard of it.</p>

<p>It was not so at Wittemberg. Melanchthon was
more grieved than ever, and many persons sympathised
with him. On the one hand, the theologians of the
Reformation detested war; but on the other, they said
to themselves at certain moments: 'Still ... if Philip
takes up arms it is to restore legitimate princes to the
throne of their fathers, and secure a free course to the
Word of God!'—'Oh, what cruelties in the Roman
Church,' added Melanchthon, 'what idolatries, and
what obstinacy in defending them! Who knows but
God desires to punish their defenders, if not utterly to
destroy such notorious evils for ever?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_601" id="Ref_601" href="#Foot_601">[601]</a></span>
Oh that the
issue of this war may be beneficial to the Church of
Christ!' Some time after, when Melanchthon was
told of the advance of the army of Philip of Hesse,
that peaceful christian gave way once more to his
anguish: 'These movements are quite against our
advice,' he said, and then shutting himself up in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">{336}</a></span>
closet, he exclaimed: 'In the midst of the dangers and
sorrows to which God exposes us, we have nothing else
to do but to call upon Christ and to feel his presence.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_602" id="Ref_602" href="#Foot_602">[602]</a></span>
He then fell upon his knees before God; and God, who
saw him in secret, rewarded him openly. But while
the christians were weeping and praying, the politicians
were rejoicing and acting. Du Bellay, in particular,
did not doubt that an early victory would cement the
union of France with German protestantism; and perceiving
the consequences that would follow from the
enfranchisement of his country, he gave utterance to
his joy.</p>

<p>The impetuous landgrave, taking a spring, cleared,
as at one bound, the country which separated him from
the Neckar, arrived unexpectedly on the banks of that
river near Laufen, where the imperial army was posted,
and attacked it with spirit. At first the Austrians
courageously sustained the fight; but the count palatine,
their commander, having been wounded by a
cannon-shot, they retired precipitately. Early the
next morning, the landgrave, putting himself at the
head of his cavalry and artillery, fell upon them as
they were beginning to retreat, and drove part of them
into the Neckar.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_603" id="Ref_603" href="#Foot_603">[603]</a></span></p>

<p>Wurtemberg was gained, and Duke Ulrich, accompanied
by Prince Christopher, reappeared in the
country of his fathers. The people, excited at the
thought of seeing their national princes once more
after so many years, assembled in the open country
near Stuttgard, and received them with immense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">{337}</a></span>
acclamation. The landgrave, not allowing himself to
be retarded by the warm reception of the people whom
he had restored to independence, followed up his plan,
and on the 18th of June reached the Austrian frontier.
Everybody thought that he would march on Vienna,
and overthrow that insolent dynasty which desired to
be the master of the world.</p>

<p class="side">=ALARM AT THE VATICAN.=</p>

<p>Great was the consternation in all the catholic
world, but particularly in the Vatican. On the 10th
of June, 1534, Clement, who was sick, went sorrowful,
downcast, and tottering, to the college of cardinals,
and laid before them the pitiful letters he had received
from King Ferdinand.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_604" id="Ref_604" href="#Foot_604">[604]</a></span>
The cardinals, as they read
them, were struck with terror. Would Vienna, that
had resisted the Turks, fall under the assault of the
protestants? Would a victorious army, crossing the
Alps, come and perpetrate a second sack of Rome
which, as the work of heretics, might not be more
compassionate than that of the catholic Charles V.?
The cardinals saw no other remedy than that to which
Rome had recourse when her ducats and arquebuses
were gone. 'A general council,' they exclaimed, 'is
the only remedy that can save us from heresy and all
the calamities by which christendom is distressed.'</p>

<p>While there was mourning at Rome, there were great
rejoicings at the Louvre. It was a long time since
the emperor had received such a check. About the
end of June a courier from Germany brought Francis
the despatches announcing the arrival of Philip of
Hesse on the Austrian frontier. He could not repress
the outburst of his joy. He spoke to himself, to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">{338}</a></span>
councillors, to his courtiers.... 'My friends,' he exclaimed,
'my friends have conquered Wurtemberg.'
Then, as if the landgrave and his victorious army
were before him, he exclaimed in a tone of command:
'Forward! forward!' His dream was about to be
realised; the war would become general; he already
saw the landgrave at Vienna; and, what was better
still, he saw himself at Genoa, Urbino, Montferrat, and
Milan. All his life through he forgot France for Italy,
which he never possessed. But he was mistaken as to
the landgrave's intentions. Much as Francis desired to
see the war become general, Philip of Hesse laboured
to keep it local. Satisfied with having restored Wurtemberg
to its princes, he meant to respect the empire.
The kings of France and England were seriously
vexed: 'The Duke of Wurtemberg, restored by my
help and yours,' said Henry VIII. to Francis I., 'is
only seeking how to make peace with the emperor.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_605" id="Ref_605" href="#Foot_605">[605]</a></span>
It would appear by the evidence derived from the
<i>State Papers</i>, that the gold of England as well as of
France had contributed to despoil Austria of Wurtemberg.
Henry, more perhaps than Francis I., had
hoped that the blow struck upon the banks of the
Neckar would be, to emperor as well as to pope, the
commencement of sorrows; but they were both mistaken.
The temptation, no doubt, was great for a prince
of thirty, full of decision and energy, who believed
that nothing would make the triumph of protestantism
so secure as the humiliation of Austria; but Philip's
loyalty resisted the temptation.</p>

<p class="side">=WURTEMBERG RESTORED.=</p>

<p>On the 27th of June the peace of Cadan put an end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">{339}</a></span>
to all differences, and restored Wurtemberg to its national
princes, with a voice in the council of the empire.
If there had never been a war more energetically conducted,
there had never been a peace so promptly
concluded. The landgrave had displayed a spirit and
talents which, men thought, might in future prove
troublesome to the puissant Charles.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_606" id="Ref_606" href="#Foot_606">[606]</a></span></p>

<p>The emperor having received his lesson, the pope's
turn came next. As the state of Wurtemberg had
been wrested from the hands of Austria, the Church
was to be saved from the clutches of the papacy. At
the diet of Augsburg, in 1530, Duke Christopher had
seen the landgrave, his relation and friend, come forward
as the most intrepid champion of the Reformation.
His generous heart had been won to a cause
which included such a noble defender, and his desire
was to see it triumph in Wurtemberg. On the other
hand, King Ferdinand, when renouncing his authority
over the duchy, desired at least to maintain that of
the pope; and he therefore proposed to insert in the
treaty of peace an article forbidding any change in
religious matters. But the dukes, the landgrave, and
the Elector of Saxony unanimously declared that the
Gospel ought to have free course in the duchy, and
the electoral chancellor wrote this word on the margin,
by the side of the article proposed by the King of the
Romans: <i>Rejected</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_607" id="Ref_607" href="#Foot_607">[607]</a></span>
'You are in no respect bound as
to the faith,' said the evangelical princes to Ulrich;
while the papal nuncio Vergerio entreated King Ferdinand
not to give way to the Lutherans. All the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">{340}</a></span>
efforts of the Romish party were useless. The important
victory of the landgrave (and of Francis I.)
was about to open the gates of Wurtemberg to the
Reformation, and consequently those of other Roman-catholic
countries.</p>

<p>Ulrich and Christopher, being quite as desirous of
bringing souls to the knowledge of the Word of God
as of replacing their subjects under the sceptre of the
ancient house of Emeric,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_608" id="Ref_608" href="#Foot_608">[608]</a></span>
 set to work immediately.
They invited to their states Ambrose Blaarer, the
friend of Zwingle and Bucer, and Ehrard Schnepf, the
friend of Luther, converted by his means at Heidelberg
at the beginning of the Reformation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_609" id="Ref_609" href="#Foot_609">[609]</a></span>
Their labours
and those of other servants of God spread the evangelical
light over the country.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_610" id="Ref_610" href="#Foot_610">[610]</a></span>
Nor was that all: if
the defeat at Cappel had restored many cities to the
Romish creed,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_611" id="Ref_611" href="#Foot_611">[611]</a></span>
the victory of Laufen allowed many
to come to the evangelical faith. Baden, Hanau,
Augsburg, Pomerania, Mecklenburg, and other places
began, advanced, or completed their reformation about
this time. French money had never before returned
such good interest.</p>

<p class="side">=A KINGLY PROJECT.=</p>

<p>France was now about to undertake a still greater
task. We have seen that there were at that time two
systems of reform: Margaret's system and Calvin's.
It was in the order of things that the one which remained
nearest to catholicism should be tried first. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">{341}</a></span>
the most eminent persons of the age, who sought in
this middle course the last and supreme resource of
christendom, did not see their efforts crowned with
success, it would be necessary to undertake, or rather
to continue spiritedly, a more simple, more scriptural,
more practical, and more radical reform. When Margaret
failed, there remained Calvin. The realisation
of this specious but illusory system, recommended in
after years to Louis XIV. by a great protestant philosopher
of Germany, was about to be tried by Francis I.
The narrative of this experiment ought to occupy a
remarkable place in the religious history of the sixteenth
century.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">CONFERENCE AT THE LOUVRE FOR THE UNION OF TRUTH AND
 CATHOLICITY IN THE CHURCH.<br />
 (1534.)</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Wurtemberg affair being ended, Du Bellay
thought of nothing but his great plan; that is, a
Reformation according to the ideas of the Queen of
Navarre—the combination of catholicism and truth
by the union of France and Germany. They were
not the only persons who entertained such thoughts:
Roussel, Bucer, and many other evangelical christians
asked themselves whether the great success obtained
in Germany would not decide the reformation of
France. Intercourse was much increased between the
two countries. Frenchmen and Germans were continually
crossing and recrossing the Rhine.</p>

<p class="side">=A WITTEMBERG STUDENT.=</p>

<p>In the month of July 1534, the Queen of Navarre
was in one of the chambers of her palace: before her
stood a bashful timid young man, and she had a letter
in her hand which she appeared to be reading with the
liveliest interest. The young man was a native of
Nîmes, Claude Baduel by name. He had just come
from Wittemberg, where he had found, at the feet of
Melanchthon and Luther, the knowledge of the Saviour.
He was not an ordinary student. Of reserved manners,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_612" id="Ref_612" href="#Foot_612">[612]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">{343}</a></span>
generous heart, rare disinterestedness, and great
firmness in the faith, he had at the same time a highly
cultivated mind. He spoke Latin not only with
purity, but with great elegance, and his discourses
were as full of matter as of harmony.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_613" id="Ref_613" href="#Foot_613">[613]</a></span></p>

<p>Like many other young scholars, Baduel was very
poor, not having the means of studying and scarcely
of living. Often during his residence at Wittemberg,
he found himself in his little room reduced to the last
extremity. He had uttered many a groan, and had
prayed to that heavenly Father who feedeth the birds
of the air. As the moment of his departure approached,
his distress had increased. How could he
perform the journey? What would become of him
in France? He had asked himself with sorrow
whether he ought not to abandon letters and devote
himself to some manual labour. On a sudden, he
conceived the idea of applying to the Queen of
Navarre; and going to Melanchthon, he said to him:
'Ill fortune compels me to forsake the liberal arts
for vulgar occupations, which my nature and my
will abhor with equal energy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_614" id="Ref_614" href="#Foot_614">[614]</a></span>
In vain have I zealously
devoted myself to the study of Holy Scripture
and of eloquence; in vain have I ardently desired to
make further progress; a cruel enemy—poverty—lays
its barbarous hands upon me, and compels me to
renounce a vocation which transported me with joy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_615" id="Ref_615" href="#Foot_615">[615]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">{344}</a></span>
Yet I am determined to make a last and supreme
attempt. The Queen of Navarre is a sort of providence,
almost a divinity for the friends of letters and of the
arts.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_616" id="Ref_616" href="#Foot_616">[616]</a></span>
... Pray, dear master, give me a letter to her.'</p>

<p>Melanchthon, grieved at the destitute condition of a
young man whose fine understanding he appreciated,
did not hesitate to accede to his request. In those
days there was less etiquette and formality and more
familiarity between princes and the friends of letters
than there has been since. On the 13th of June, 1534,
a month after the battle of Laufen, the master of
Germany wrote to the sister of Francis, to introduce
the scholar to her. It was this letter which Baduel
had delivered to the queen, and which she, delighted
at entering into direct communication with Melanchthon,
was reading with the greatest interest.</p>

<p>'It is certainly a great boldness,' wrote the illustrious
reformer, 'for a man like me, of low condition
and unknown to your highness,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_617" id="Ref_617" href="#Foot_617">[617]</a></span>
to dare recommend
a friend to you; but the reputation of your eminent
piety, spread through all the world,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_618" id="Ref_618" href="#Foot_618">[618]</a></span>
does not permit
me to refuse an upright and learned man the service
he begs of me. The liberal arts can never be supported
except by the generosity of princes.' Melanchthon
ended by saying: 'Never will alms more royal
or more useful have been bestowed. The Church,
scattered over the world, has long counted your highness
among the number of those queens whom the
prophet Isaiah calls the <i>nursing mothers</i> of the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">{345}</a></span>
of God, and will take care to hand down the remembrance
of your kindnesses to the most distant generations.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_619" id="Ref_619" href="#Foot_619">[619]</a></span>
But the student, that living message of the
reformers, interested Margaret no less than the letter
itself. Baduel had seen and heard them, in their
homes, in the street, and in the pulpit. 'Talk to me,'
she said with that amiable grace which distinguished
her, 'talk to me about Melanchthon and Luther; tell
me how they teach and how they live, what are their
relations with their pupils, and what they think of
France.' Margaret desired to know everything. She
questioned him on several points, a knowledge of which
might be useful for the projects she had conceived in
conjunction with Du Bellay.</p>

<p class="side">=MARGARET'S PATRONAGE.=</p>

<p>The queen did not forget the young man himself:
observing the beauty of his mind, the liveliness of his
faith, and the elevation of his soul, she thought that to
protect Baduel was to prepare a chosen instrument to
propagate evangelical principles in France. Thanks
to her care, the young man, recommended by Melanchthon,
became erelong a professor at Paris. Subsequently,
when a college of arts was founded at Nîmes,
the youthful doctor resolved to sacrifice the advantageous
post he held in the capital to devote his
services to the city of his birth. The queen recommended
him to the consuls of that city for rector of
their new institution. 'I provided for his studies,' she
told them. But persecution did not allow Baduel to
serve France unto the end; he was obliged to take
refuge at Geneva, where he became professor in the
academy founded by Calvin.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_620" id="Ref_620" href="#Foot_620">[620]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">{346}</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE MISSION OF CHELIUS=</p>

<p>The communications of the young man of Nîmes
strengthened Margaret, the king, and Du Bellay in
their plans, and Francis resolved to send across the
Rhine a confidential person, empowered to ask the
doctors of the Reformation for a sketch of the means
best suited to found an evangelical catholicism in
Europe. It was not Baduel whom Du Bellay selected
for this mission: he was too young. The diplomatist
cast his eyes on Ulric Chelius, a doctor of medicine
and native of Augsburg, at that time living at Strasburg,
a great friend of Sturm and Bucer, and more
than once employed by the King of France in various
negotiations. Intelligent, active, and animated like
Bucer with the double desire of reforming and at the
same time of uniting christendom, Chelius was well
suited for such a work. Although a German, and
consequently knowing Germany thoroughly, he had
all the promptitude of a Frenchman; and the circumstance
that he was not of exalted rank rendered him
fitter still for entering into negotiations that were to
be carried on secretly. He left Strasburg and arrived
at Wittemberg in July 1534.</p>

<p>Melanchthon was at that time greatly agitated. The
divisions which separated catholicism from reform, and
the quarrels between the Zwinglians and the Lutherans,
filled him with anguish. He often stole away
from that crowd of every age, condition, and country
which continually filled his house, eager to see him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_621" id="Ref_621" href="#Foot_621">[621]</a></span>
His wife's anxious heart was wrung when she saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">{347}</a></span>
her husband's sadness, and even the children could
scarcely cheer him by their innocent smiles. The
future alarmed him.... 'What sad times are hanging
over us,' he exclaimed, 'unless there be somebody to
remedy the existing disorders!... We are moving
to our destruction.... They will have recourse to
arms ... and State and Church will perish!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_622" id="Ref_622" href="#Foot_622">[622]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as Chelius reached Wittemberg, he called
upon Melanchthon. 'King Francis,' he said, 'desires
truth and unity. In almost every particular he is in
accord with you, and approves of your book of

I am authorised to ask you for a
plan to put an end to the religious dissensions which
disturb christendom; and I can assure you that the
King of France is doing, and will do, all he can with
the pope to procure harmony and peace.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_624" id="Ref_624" href="#Foot_624">[624]</a></span>
Nothing
was better adapted to captivate Melanchthon. At
this period the <i>moderates</i> had not yet renounced the
idea of preserving external unity; they desired to
maintain catholicity: even Melanchthon saw no other
safety for divided and agitated christendom. Accordingly,
never had message arrived at a more suitable
time. Chelius was to him like an angel come from
heaven; a beam of joy lighted up the great doctor's
clouded brow. He went to see Luther, and conversed
with him and other friends about the proposals of the
King of France. 'If a few good and learned men,'
said he, 'brought together by certain sovereigns, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">{348}</a></span>
to confer freely and amicably together, it would be
easy, believe me, to come to an understanding with
each other.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_625" id="Ref_625" href="#Foot_625">[625]</a></span>
Ignorant men know nothing about the
matter, and make the evil greater than it is.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_626" id="Ref_626" href="#Foot_626">[626]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON THE UNION.=</p>

<p>Melanchthon thought that he could unite catholics
and protestants. We must not be surprised at it,
for in our days very estimable, though not very clear-sighted
men, entertain the same idea. Truth was
dear to the doctor of Germany, but concord, unity,
and catholicity were not less so. The Church, according
to Melanchthon and his friends, ought to be
universal; for redemption is appointed for all men,
and all have need of it. The Church ought therefore
to strive to unite all the children of Adam in communion
with God, on the foundation of Christ, the only
Redeemer. It possesses a power which can embrace
all humankind and keep all differences in subjection.
Such were the thoughts by which Melanchthon was
inspired: if there were any sacrifices to be made to
preserve the catholicity of the Church, he would
gladly make them; he would recognise the bishops,
and even the head of the bishops, rather than destroy
unity. 'There is no question of abolishing the
government of the Church,' he said; 'the chief men
among us ardently desire that the received forms
should be preserved as much as possible.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_627" id="Ref_627" href="#Foot_627">[627]</a></span>
Luther's friend took the matter so much to heart that he began
to address Du Bellay personally: 'I entreat you,' he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">{349}</a></span>
said, 'to prevail upon the great monarchs to establish
a concord which shall be consistent with piety.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_628" id="Ref_628" href="#Foot_628">[628]</a></span>
The dangers which threaten us are such that so great a
man as you ought not to be wanting in the cause
of the State and of the Church.... But what am I
doing?... What need to urge you to walk who are
running already?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_629" id="Ref_629" href="#Foot_629">[629]</a></span>
<i>Catholicity and truth</i>: such was
the device graven on the arms borne by the champions
who, under the auspices of the King of France,
were to appear between the two camps of Rome and
the Reformation.</p>

<p>Melanchthon busied himself with sketching the plan
of the new Church, which, with God's help and the
support of the <i>great monarchs</i> (Francis I., Henry VIII.,
and probably Charles V.), was to become the Church
of modern times. It might be eventually one of the
most important labours ever undertaken by man. Not
only the politicians, but all pious, loving, and perhaps
feeble hearts, who feared controversy more than anything,
ardently hoped for the success of this heroic
attempt. The <i>chief men</i>, said Melanchthon, shared his
opinion and encouraged his projects. Yet there were
simple, earnest, christian men, with minds determined
to set truth above everything, who saw with uneasiness
these theologico-diplomatic negotiations. Neither
Farel, nor Calvin, nor probably Luther, was among
those who rallied round the standard raised by Du
Bellay and grasped by Melanchthon.</p>

<p>That pious man, however, was far from wishing to
sacrifice the truth. 'I am quite of your opinion,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">{350}</a></span>
said he to Bucer, 'that there can be no agreement
between us and the Bishop of Rome.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_630" id="Ref_630" href="#Foot_630">[630]</a></span>
But, to satisfy
the worthy men who are endeavouring to bring this
great matter to a happy issue, I shall lay down what
ought to be the essential points of agreement.'
Melanchthon then believed, and many evangelical
christians in France, and particularly in Germany,
believed also, that if a reform, though incomplete,
were once established, the power of truth would
soon bring about a complete reform. He therefore
finished his sketch and gave it to Chelius.</p>

<p class="side">=NOTES OF THE THREE DOCTORS.=</p>

<p>The latter, imagining that he held the salvation of
the Church in his hands, hastened to Strasburg to
communicate Melanchthon's project to his friends.
On arriving at Bucer's house (17th of August), he
found him writing his answer to the <i>Catholic Axiom</i>
of the Bishop of Avranches, a great enemy of
protestantism. Bucer put aside his own papers and
took those of the Wittemberg doctor, which he was
impatient to see. He read them eagerly over and
over again. 'Really there is nothing here to offend
anybody,' he said, 'if people have the least idea of
what the reign of Christ means. But, my dear
Chelius,' he added, 'a union is possible only among
those who truly believe in Christ. That there should
be a superior authority, well and good! but it must be
a holy authority in order that every man may obey
it with a good conscience.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_631" id="Ref_631" href="#Foot_631">[631]</a></span>
If we are to unite, all
additions must be cut away, and we must return
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">{351}</a></span>
simply to the doctrine of Scripture and of the
Fathers.'</p>

<p>Chelius desired Bucer to give him his opinion in
writing. The reformer hastily drew up a memoir,
which, being approved by his colleagues, he handed
to his friend on the 27th of August.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_632" id="Ref_632" href="#Foot_632">[632]</a></span>
Francis's agent
had fixed that day for his departure; but at the last
moment he changed his mind, and remained twenty-four
hours longer in Strasburg. There was another
doctor in that city, a meek, pious, and firm man, an
old friend of Zwingle's:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_633" id="Ref_633" href="#Foot_633">[633]</a></span>
it was Hedio, and Chelius
asked him for his opinion also. Then, taking with
him the memoirs of the three doctors, he started
without delay for Paris, convinced that catholicity
and truth were about to be saved.</p>

<p>On reaching the capital Chelius gave the papers to
William du Bellay, who immediately laid them before
the king. The latter ordered that the Bishop of Paris
and certain of the nobles, men of letters, and ecclesiastics,
who desired to see a united but reformed
Church, should have these documents communicated
to them. The arrival of this ultimatum of the
Reformation was an event of great importance; and
accordingly the memoirs of the three doctors were
anxiously perused at the Louvre, in the bishop's
palace, and in other houses of the capital. Perhaps
history has made a mistake in taking so little note of
this. Three of the reformers, with England, Francis I.,
and some of the most eminent men of the epoch,
demanded one only catholic but reformed Church.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">{352}</a></span>
A great evangelical unity seemed on the point of being
realised. Shall we not set forth in some detail a proposal
of such high interest? There are individuals,
we are aware, who are always looking for facts and
sensations, never troubling themselves about principles
and doctrines; but the wise, on the contrary, know
that the world is moved by ideas, and, whatever may
be the objections of curious minds, history must
perform her task, and give to opinions the place that
belongs to them.</p>

<p>At this time several meetings of an extraordinary
kind were held at the Louvre, and upon them, as some
thought, the future of christendom depended. The
opinions of Melanchthon, Bucer, and Hedio, demanded
by the king, brought by Chelius, and laid before the
monarch by Du Bellay, were in his majesty's closet.
The walls of the Louvre, which had witnessed such
levity of morals, and which hereafter were to witness
so many crimes, heard those holy truths explained in
which everlasting life is to be found. Around the table
on which these documents lay, there were politicians
no doubt who in this investigation looked only to
temporal advantages, and Francis was at their head;
but there were also serious men who desired for the
new Church both unity and reform. We will let the
reformers speak. They were not present in person,
it will be understood, before the King of France;
it is their written advice which he had asked for,
and which was probably read by one of the Du
Bellays. But, for brevity's sake, we shall designate
these memoirs by the names of their authors, since it
is the authors themselves who speak, and not the
historian.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">{353}</a></div>

<p class="side">=THE PROPOSALS EXAMINED.=</p>

<p>Francis I., eager both to emancipate France from its
subordination to the papacy, and to form in Europe
a great united party capable of vanquishing and
thwarting Austria, listened with goodwill to Melanchthon
and his friends; yet he found the language of
the reformers a little more severe and <i>heretical</i> than
he had imagined. Some of the persons around him
were pleased; some were astonished, and others were
scandalised, and not without reason. To place the moderate
Melanchthon by the side of the pacific Bishop
of Paris, well and good! but to hope to unite the unyielding
Luther and the fiery Beda, the pious elector
and the worldly Francis ... what a strange undertaking!
Let us listen, however; for these personages
have taken their seats, and the inquiry is about to
begin.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_634" id="Ref_634" href="#Foot_634">[634]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smc">Bucer.</span></h4>

<p>'There can be no concord in the Church except
between those who are really of the Church.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_635" id="Ref_635" href="#Foot_635">[635]</a></span>
There is nothing in common between Christ and Belial. We
cannot unite God and the world.... Now, what are the
majority of bishops and priests?... I grieve to say.'</p>

<p>This introduction appeared to the king rather
high-flown; but he said to himself that Bucer doubtless
wished to make protestation of his loyalty at the
very outset. Perhaps his colleagues will be more
conciliating.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">{354}</a></div>

<h4><span class="smc">Melanchthon.</span></h4>

<p>'The catholic doctrine, say some, has a few trifling
blemishes here and there; while we and our friends
have been making a great noise without any cause....
That is a mistake. Let not the pontiff and the great
monarchs of christendom shut their eyes to the diseases
of the Church.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_636" id="Ref_636" href="#Foot_636">[636]</a></span>
They ought, on the contrary, to
acknowledge that these pretended trifling blemishes
destroy the essential doctrines of the faith, and lead
men into idolatry and manifest sin.'</p>

<h4><span class="smc">Bucer.</span></h4>

<p>'If you wish to establish christian concord, apply
to those who truly believe in Christ.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_637" id="Ref_637" href="#Foot_637">[637]</a></span>
Those who do
not listen to the Word cannot explain the Word....
What errors have been introduced by wicked priests!
Shall we apply to other priests to correct them, who
perhaps surpass the former in wickedness?'</p>

<p>Really the pacific Bucer and Melanchthon speak as
boldly as Luther and Farel. The king and his councillors
were beginning to be alarmed, but more conciliatory
words revived their hopes.</p>

<h4><span class="smc">Bucer.</span></h4>

<p>'All that can be conceded, while maintaining the
faith and the love of God, we will concede. Every
salutary custom, observed by the ancients, we will
restore. We have no desire to upset everything that
is standing, and we know very well that the Church
here below cannot be without blemish.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_638" id="Ref_638" href="#Foot_638">[638]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">{355}</a></div>

<p class="gap-above2 side">~CHURCH GOVERNMENT.~</p>

<p>The satisfaction of the king and his councillors
increased when they came to Church government.
There must be order in the Church, said the protestants.
There must be a ministry of the Word;
an inspection of the pastors and of the flocks, in
order to secure discipline and peace. The service,
the time appointed for worshipping in common, the
place where the Church should assemble, the holy
offices, the temporal aid necessary for the support of
the ministry, the care of the poor: all these things
require an attentive and faithful administration.
These principles were set forth by the reformers, the
Strasburg doctor insisting most on this point.</p>

<h4><span class="smc">Bucer.</span></h4>

<p>'The kingdom of Christ ought not to be without a
government. In no place ought order to be stricter,
obedience more complete, and power more respected.'</p>

<p>Francis I. and his councillors heard these declarations
with pleasure. They had been told that the
<i>pretended</i> Church of the protestants was composed of
atoms that had no cohesion with each other. Others
affirmed that the only superior power recognised in
it was that of certain theocratic prophets, like Thomas
Munzer and others. Francis, therefore, was satisfied
to learn that while they acknowledged a universal
priesthood, by virtue of which every believer approached
God in prayer, protestantism maintained a
special evangelical ministry. But what was this
ministry, this government? This the king and his
advisers desired to know. Here, in our opinion, the
mediating divines went wrong: the king's wishes were
to be almost satisfied.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">{356}</a></div>

<h4><span class="smc">Melanchthon.</span></h4>

<p>'As a bishop presides over several Churches, no
one can think it wrong for a pontiff to preside at
Rome over several bishops. The Church must have
leaders to examine those who are called to the ministry,
to judge in ecclesiastical causes, and watch over the
teaching of the ministers.... If there were no such
bishops, they ought to be created.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_639" id="Ref_639" href="#Foot_639">[639]</a></span>
One sole pontiff
may even serve to maintain harmony of faith between
the different nations of christendom.'</p>

<p>Francis was delighted; but the more decided evangelicals
looked upon this idea of an <i>evangelical</i> pope as
a dream to be consigned to the Utopia described by
Sir Thomas More. An accessory declaration of another
kind was to please the king even more.</p>

<h4><span class="smc">Melanchthon.</span></h4>

<p>'As for the Roman pontiff's claim to transfer kingdoms
from one prince to another, that concerns neither
the Gospel nor the Church; and it is the business of
kings to combat that unjust pretension.'</p>

<p>Now that these concessions were granted, the reformers
were about to make the loud voice of the
Reformation heard.</p>

<p class="gap-above2 side">~JUSTIFICATION AND THE MASS.~</p>

<h4><span class="smc">Bucer.</span></h4>

<p>'The first of doctrines is the justification of sinners.'</p>

<h4><span class="smc">Melanchthon.</span></h4>

<p>'Remission of sins ought to be accompanied by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">{357}</a></span>
change of life; but this remission is not given us
because of this new life; it comes to us only through
mercy, and is given to us solely because of Christ.'</p>

<h4><span class="smc">Bucer.</span></h4>

<p>'Thus, then, we have done with the merits ascribed
to the observances and prayers of the monks and
priests: we have done with all vain confidence in our
own works. Let the grace of God be obscured no
longer, and the righteousness of Christ be no more
diminished! It is on account of the blood of his only
Son that God forgives us our sins.'</p>

<p>Francis and his advisers thought that <i>orthodox</i>
enough. Even the schoolmen (they said) have used
this language in some of their books. They raised
no opposition to the opinion of the reformers upon
justification by faith.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_640" id="Ref_640" href="#Foot_640">[640]</a></span>
But one point made them
uneasy.... What will they say of the mass? This
important subject was not forgotten.</p>

<h4><span class="smc">Bucer.</span></h4>

<p>'What! to be present every day at mass without
repentance, without piety, even without thinking of
the mysteries connected with it, will suffice to obtain
all kinds of grace from God!... No! when we celebrate
the sacrament of our Lord's body and blood,
there must be a living communion between Christ
and the living members of Christ.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_641" id="Ref_641" href="#Foot_641">[641]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">{358}</a></div>

<p class="gap-above2 side">~PROTEST AGAINST ABUSES.~</p>

<h4><span class="smc">Melanchthon.</span></h4>

<p>'The mass is the only knot we cannot untie;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_642" id="Ref_642" href="#Foot_642">[642]</a></span>
for it contains such horrible abuses ... invented for the
profit of the monks. All impious rites must be interdicted,
and others established in conformity with the
truth.'</p>

<p>'The mass must be preserved,' said Francis; 'but
the stupid, absurd, and foolish legends abolished.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_643" id="Ref_643" href="#Foot_643">[643]</a></span></p>

<p>The Frenchmen were anxious to learn the doctrine
of the reformers on the sacraments: it was, in fact, the
embarrassing point, in consequence of the different
opinions of different doctors. The enemies of the
Reformation spread the rumour through France that
the sacraments were to protestants mere ceremonies
only, by which christians show that they belong to the
Church. 'No,' said the doctors, 'these outward forms
are means by which grace works inwardly in our souls.
Only this working does not proceed from the disposition
of the priest administering the sacrament, but
from the faith of him who receives it.' And here
came the great question: 'Is Christ present or not
in the communion?' Bucer and his friends cleverly
extricated themselves from this difficulty.</p>

<h4><span class="smc">Bucer.</span></h4>

<p>'The body of Christ is received in the hands of the
communicants, and eaten with their mouths, say some.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">{359}</a></span>
The body of Christ is discerned by the soul of the believer
and eaten by faith, say others. There is a way
of putting an end to this dispute by simply acknowledging
that, whatever be the manner of eating, there
is a real <i>presence of Christ</i> in the Lord's Supper.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_644" id="Ref_644" href="#Foot_644">[644]</a></span></p>

<p>By degrees the reformers became more animated.</p>

<h4><span class="smc">Melanchthon.</span></h4>

<p>'We must teach the people that the saints are not
more merciful than Jesus Christ, and that we must not
transfer to them the confidence due to Christ alone.</p>

<p>'The monasteries must be converted into schools.</p>

<p>'Celibacy must be abolished, for most of the priests
live in open uncleanness.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_645" id="Ref_645" href="#Foot_645">[645]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smc">Bucer.</span></h4>

<p>'The Church must have a constitution in which
everything will be decided by Scripture; and a conference
of learned and pious men is wanted to draw
it up.'</p>

<h4><span class="smc">Hedio.</span></h4>

<p>'That assembly must not be composed of divines
only, but of laymen also; and, above all things, no
forward step should be taken so long as the pope and
the bishops persist in their errors, and even defend
them by force.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_646" id="Ref_646" href="#Foot_646">[646]</a></span></p>

<p>When the reformers drew up these articles, they
had gradually begun to feel some hope. It is possible,
perhaps probable, that unity will be restored....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">{360}</a></span>
Moved at the thought, they lifted their eyes towards
the mighty arm from which they expected help.</p>

<h4><span class="smc">Melanchthon.</span></h4>

<p>'O that the Lord Jesus Christ would look down
from heaven and restore the Church for which he
suffered to a pious and perpetual union, which may
cause his glory to shine afar!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_647" id="Ref_647" href="#Foot_647">[647]</a></span></p>

<p>Francis and his councillors were satisfied upon the
whole;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_648" id="Ref_648" href="#Foot_648">[648]</a></span>
but the doctors of Rome looked with an uneasy
eye upon these (to them) detestable negotiations.
There was agitation at the Sorbonne and even at the
Louvre. All the leaders of the Roman party who had
a voice at court made respectful representations. Cardinal
de Tournon added remonstrances. Du Bellay
held firm; but it was not so with Francis. He hesitated
and staggered. An event occurred to give him
a fresh impulse, and to legitimatise in his eyes the
reforms demanded by his minister.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XXXV.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">THE APPARITION AT ORLEANS.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Summer 1534.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="side">=THE PROVOST'S WIFE.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">CALVIN, as it will be remembered, had studied and
evangelised at Orleans, and his teaching had left
deep traces, particularly among the students and with
certain ladies of quality. The wife of the city provost
seems to have been one of the souls converted by the
ministry of the young reformer. The narrative he
has devoted to her, the full details into which he
enters, show the interest he took in her conversion.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_649" id="Ref_649" href="#Foot_649">[649]</a></span>
This woman, who occupied a distinguished rank in
the city, had found peace for her soul in faith in
Christ; she had believed in the promises of the Word
which Calvin had explained; she had felt keenly
the nothingness of Roman pomps and superstitions;
the grace of God was sufficient for her; and caring
little for <i>outward adorning</i>, she strove after that <i>which
is not corruptible</i>, the ornament of the <i>women who trusted
in God</i>. 'She is a Lutheran,' said some; 'she belongs
to those who have listened to the teaching of Luther's
disciples.' Her husband the provost, a person of influence,
a great landowner, an esteemed magistrate, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">{362}</a></span>
man of upright, prompt, and energetic character, was
touched by the purity of his wife's conduct, and, without
being converted to the Gospel, had become disgusted
with the Roman superstitions, and despised the
monks.</p>

<p>The provostess (to adopt the language of the
manuscripts) fell ill, sent for a lawyer, and dictated
her will to him. Lying on a bed of sickness, which
she was never to leave again, full of a living faith
in Christ, she felt certain of going to her Saviour,
and experienced an insurmountable repugnance to
the performance over her grave of any of the superstitious
ceremonies for which devout women have
ordinarily such a strong liking. Accordingly, while the
notary, pen in hand, was waiting the dictation of
her last will, she said: 'I forbid all bell-ringing and
chanting at my funeral, and no monks or priests
shall be present with their tapers. I desire to be
buried without pomp and without torches.' The lawyer
was rather surprised, but he wrote down the words;
and her husband, who remained near her and knew
her faith, promised that her wishes should be kept
sacred. When she died, the mortal remains of this
pious woman were laid in the tomb of her father and
grandfather, with no other accompaniment than the
tears of all who had known her, and the prayers of the
children of God who formed the little evangelical flock
of Orleans.</p>

<p class="side">=THE PROVOST AND THE MONKS.=</p>

<p>When the ceremony was over, the provost proceeded
to the convent of the Franciscans, in whose cemetery
the burial had taken place. He was a liberal man,
and, though despising the monks, did not wish to
do them wrong, even in appearance. The friars,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">{363}</a></span>
already much irritated, did not understand what the
magistrate wanted with them, and received him very
coldly. 'As you were not called upon to do duty,'
he told them, 'here are six gold crowns by way of
compensation.' The monks, who had reckoned on the
death of this lady as a great windfall, were by no
means satisfied with the six gold pieces; and, even
while taking them, looked sulkily at the widower, and
swore to be revenged.</p>

<p>Not long after this, the provost having determined
upon cutting down a wood he possessed near Orleans,
was giving directions to his workmen, when two monks,
following the narrow lanes running through the forest,
arrived at the spot where the owner and the woodmen
were at work, boldly addressed the former, and demanded
in the name of the convent permission to
send their waggon once a day during the felling to
lay up their store. 'What!' answered the provost,
whom the avarice of the monks had always disgusted,
'a waggon a day! Send thirty, my reverend fathers,
but (of course) with ready money. All that I want,
I assure you, is good speed and good money.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_650" id="Ref_650" href="#Foot_650">[650]</a></span></p>

<p>The two cordeliers returned abashed and vexed,
and carried the answer to their superiors. This was
too much: two affronts one after the other! The
monks consulted together; they desired to be revenged
by any means; such <i>heresies</i>, if they were tolerated,
would be the ruin of the convents. They deliberated
on the best manner of giving a striking lesson to the
provost and to all who might be tempted to follow
the example of his wife. 'These gentlemen, to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">{364}</a></span>
revenged, proceeded to devise a fraud,' says Calvin.
Two monks particularly distinguished themselves
among the speakers: brother Coliman, provincial and
exorcist of great reputation among the grey friars, and
brother Stephen of Arras, 'esteemed a great preacher.'
These two doctors, wishing to teach the city that
monks are not to be offended with impunity, invented
a 'tragedy,' which, they thought, would everywhere
excite a horror of Lutheranism.</p>

<p>Brother Stephen undertook to begin the drama:
he shut himself up in his cell and composed, in a style
of the most vulgar eloquence, a sermon which he
fancied would terrify everybody. The news of a
homily from the great preacher circulated through the
city, and when the day arrived, he went up into the
pulpit and delivered before a large congregation (for
the church was crammed) a 'very touching' discourse,
in which he pathetically described the sufferings of
the souls in purgatory.... 'You know it,' he exclaimed,
'you know it. The unhappy spirits, tormented
by the fire, escape; they return after death,
sometimes with great tumult, and pray that some
consolation may be given them. Luther, indeed,
asserts that there is no purgatory.... What horror!
what abominable impiety!' 'The friar forgot nothing,'
says Beza, 'to convince his audience that spirits return
from purgatory.' The congregation dispersed
in great excitement; and after that the least noise at
night frightened the devout. The way being thus
prepared, the impudent monks arranged among themselves
the horrible drama which was to avenge them
on the provost and his wife.</p>

<p class="side">=THE APPARITION IN THE CONVENT.=</p>

<p>On the following night the monks rose at the usual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">{365}</a></span>
hour and entered the church, carrying their antiphonaires
or anthem-books in their hands. They
began to chant; their hoarse voices were intoning
matins ... when suddenly a frightful tumult was
heard, coming from heaven as it seemed, or at least
from the ceiling of the church. On hearing this
'great uproar,' the chanting ceased, the monks appeared
horrified, and Coliman, the bravest, moved
forward, armed with all the weapons of an exorcist,
and <i>conjured</i> the evil spirit; but the spirit said not a
word. 'What wantest thou?' asked Coliman. There
was no answer. 'If thou art dumb,' resumed the
exorcist, 'show it us by some sign.' Upon this the
spirit made another uproar. The hearers, not in the
secret, were terror-stricken. 'All is going on well,'
said Coliman, Stephen, and their accomplices; 'now
let us circulate the news through Orleans.' The next
day the friars visited some of the most considerable
personages of the city who were among the number of
their devotees. 'A misfortune has happened to us,'
they said, without mentioning what it was; 'will you
come to our help and be present at our matins?'</p>

<p>These worthy citizens, anxious to know what
was the matter, did not go to bed, and went to the
convent at midnight. The monks had already
assembled in the church to chant their collects,
anthems, and litanies; they provided good places
for the devout laymen, and with trembling voices
began to intone:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Domine! labia</i>...</p>

<p>The words had hardly been uttered, when a frightful
noise interrupted the chanting. 'The ghost!
the ghost!' exclaimed the terrified monks. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">{366}</a></span>
Coliman, who had 'the usual equipment when he
wished to speak to the devil,' came forward, and,
playing his part admirably, said, 'Who art thou?'—Silence.—'What
dost thou want?'—Silence.—'Art
thou dumb?'—Silence.—'If thou art not permitted to
speak,' said Coliman, 'answer my questions by signs....
For <i>Yes</i>, give two knocks; and three for <i>No</i>. Now,
tell me ... art thou not the ghost of a person buried
here?' The ghost began to knock <i>Yes</i>. Then resumed
Coliman: 'Art thou the ghost of such a one, or such
a one?' naming in succession many of those who were
buried in the church; but to each question the ghost
answered <i>No</i>. After a long circuit, the exorcist
came at last to the point he desired: 'Art thou the
ghost of the provostess?' The spirit replied with a
loud <i>Yes</i>. The mystery seemed about to be cleared
up: a new act of the comedy began. 'Spirit, for
what sin hast thou been condemned?' asked the
exorcist: 'Is it for pride?'—<i>No!</i> 'Is it for unchastity?'—<i>No!</i>
Coliman, after running through all
the sins enumerated in Scripture, bethought himself
at last, and said: 'Art thou condemned for having
been a Lutheran?' Two knocks answered <i>Yes</i>, and
all the monks crossed themselves in alarm. 'Now
tell us,' continued the exorcist, 'why thou makest
such an uproar in the middle of the night? Is it for
thy body to be exhumed?'—<i>Yes!</i> There could no
longer be any doubt about it: the provostess was
suffering for her Lutheranism. The report had been
prepared beforehand, but a few witnesses refused
to sign it, suspecting some trick. The provincial
concealed his vexation, and wishing to excite their
imaginations still more strongly, he exclaimed: 'The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">{367}</a></span>
place is profaned; let us leave it ... as the papal
canons command.' Forthwith one of the monks
caught up the pyx containing the <i>corpus Domini</i>;
another seized the chalice; others took the relics
of the saints and 'the rest of their tools;'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_651" id="Ref_651" href="#Foot_651">[651]</a></span>
and all fled into the chapter-room, where divine service was
thenceforward celebrated.</p>

<p class="side">=INQUEST ON THE SPIRIT.=</p>

<p>The news of this affair soon reached the ears of the
bishop's official, and there was much talk about it at
the palace. The Franciscans were pretty well known
there. 'There is some monkish trick at the bottom,'
said the official, an estimable and upright clergyman.
He could not conceal his disgust at this cheat of the
friars. He thought that these impetuous cordeliers
would compromise, and perhaps ruin the cause of
religion, instead of advancing it, by their pretended
miracles. It was to be one of the peculiarities of protestantism
to unveil the cunning, avarice, and hypocrisy
of the priests, the workers of miracles. Extraordinary
acts of the divine power were manifested at the time
of the creation of the Church, as at the time when the
heavens and the earth were first made by the Word of
God. Is not all creation a miracle? But the Reformation
turned away with disgust from the tricks and
cheats of the Roman mountebanks, who presumed
to ape the power of God. There were even in the
Catholic Church men of good sense who shared this
opinion. Of this number was the official of Orleans,
the man who filled the place which some had destined
for Calvin.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">{368}</a></div>

<p>He took with him a few honest people, and went to
the grey friars' church to inquire more particularly
into the fact. He called the monks together: brother
Coliman gravely told the whole story, and the official,
after hearing their tales, said: 'Well, my brethren, I
now order these conjurations to be performed in my
presence.—You, gentlemen,' he said to some of his
party, 'will mount to the roof and see if any ghost
appears.'—'Do nothing of the kind,' exclaimed friar
Stephen of Arras, in great alarm; 'you will disturb
the spirit!' The official insisted that the conjuration
should be performed; but it was not possible; the
exorcist and the ghost both remained dumb. The
episcopal judge withdrew, confirmed in his views.
'Here's a ghost that appears only to the monks,'
he said to his companions; 'it is frightened at the
official.' This affair, which made some tremble and
others smile, soon became known throughout the city;
the news reached the dark and winding streets where
the students lived: one told it to another, and all
hurried off to the university. Everything was in commotion
there: some were for the monks, the majority
against them. 'Let us go and see,' exclaimed this
young France. Off they started, and arriving in a
large body, says Calvin, soon filled the church. They
raised their heads, they fixed their eyes on the roof
that had become so celebrated; but they waited in
vain, it uttered no sound. 'Pshaw!' said they, 'it
is a plot the friars have wickedly contrived to be
revenged of the provost and his wife. We will find
out all about it.' These curious and rather frolicsome
youths rushed to the roof in search of the ghost;
they looked for it in every corner, they called it, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">{369}</a></span>
the phantom was determined to be neither seen nor
heard, and the students returned to the university,
joking as they went.</p>

<p class="side">=THE PROVOST APPEALS TO THE KING.=</p>

<p>There was one person, however, in Orleans who did
not joke: it was the provost. Irritated at the insult
offered to his wife, he had recourse to the law: a
written summons was left at the convent, but the
monks refused to put in an answer, pleading the immunities
they enjoyed in their ecclesiastical quality.
The provost, true to his character, was not willing to
lose this opportunity of giving the friars a severe
lesson. 'What!' he exclaimed, 'shall these wretches
make her, who rests at peace in the grave, the talk of
the whole city? If she had been accused in her lifetime,
I would have defended her, much more will I do
so after her death!' He determined to lay the matter
before the king, and set out for Paris.</p>

<p>The story of the ghost who appeared with a great
noise in a convent at Orleans, had already reached the
capital, and been repeated at court. The monks, in
general, were not in high favour there. The courtiers
called to mind the words of the king's mother, who
thanked God for having taught her son and herself to
know 'those hypocrites, white, grey, black, and of all
colours.' Du Bellay especially and his friends gladly
welcomed a story which set in bold relief the vices of
the old system and the necessity of a reform. As
soon as the provost reached the capital, he had an
audience of the king. Francis, who was not famed
for his conjugal affections, could not understand the
emotion of the widower; but despising the monks
at least as much as his mother and sister did, and
delighted to put in practice the new reforming ideas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">{370}</a></span>
which were growing in his mind, he resolved to seize
the opportunity of humbling the insolence of the convents.
He granted all the provost asked; he nominated
councillors of parliament to investigate the matter; and
as the cordeliers pleaded their immunities, Duprat, in
his quality of legate, gave, by papal authority, power
to the commissioners to proceed.</p>

<p>The day when the royal agents arrived at Orleans
was a day of sorrow to one part of the inhabitants of
that city, but of joy to the greater number. People
looked with astonishment on these gentlemen from
Paris, who would be stronger than the monks, and
would punish them for their long tyranny. A crowd
followed them to the convent, and when they had entered,
waited until they came out again. Oh! how
every one of them would have liked to see what was
going on within those gloomy walls! The officers of
the parliament spoke to the monks with authority,
exhibited their powers, and arrested the principal
culprits, to the great consternation of all the other
monks. Some wretched carts stood at the gate of
the monastery; the archers brought out the insolent
friars; and the crowd, to its unutterable amazement,
saw them mount like vulgar criminals into these poor
vehicles, which the maréchaussée was preparing to
escort. What inexpressible disgrace for the disciples
of St. Francis!</p>

<p class="side">=THE MONKS TAKEN TO PARIS.=</p>

<p>The news of the arrest had spread to all the
sacristies, parsonages, and convents of the city, and a
cry of persecution arose everywhere. At the moment
of departure, a bigoted and excited crowd collected
round the carts in which sat the reverend fathers,
quite out of countenance at their misfortune. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">{371}</a></span>
people, some of whom no doubt were fanatics, but
amongst whom were many who felt a sincere affection
for the monks, wept bitterly; they uttered loud
lamentations, and put money into the friars' hands,
'as much to make good cheer with,' says Calvin, 'as
to help in their defence.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_652" id="Ref_652" href="#Foot_652">[652]</a></span>
But in the midst of this
dejected crowd might be observed some citizens and
jeering students, who exclaimed: 'Fine champions,
indeed, to oppose the Gospel!' Certain sayings of
Luther had crossed the Rhine, and were circulating
among the youths of the schools: 'Who made the
monks?' asked one. 'The devil,' answered another.
'God having created the priests, the devil (as is always
the case) wished to imitate him, but in his bungling
he made the crown of the head too large, and instead
of a priest he turned out a monk.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_653" id="Ref_653" href="#Foot_653">[653]</a></span>
Such was the
exodus of the reverend fathers: they arrived in Paris,
and there they were separated and confined in different
places, in order that they might not confer with one
another.</p>

<p>The deception was manifest, but it was impossible
to obtain a confession. The monks had sworn to keep
profound silence, in order to preserve the honour of
their order and of religion, and also to save themselves.
They called to mind what had happened in the Dominican
convent at Berne in 1500: how a soul had appeared
there in order to be delivered from purgatory;
how the five wounds of St. Francis had been marked
on a poor novice; and how, at the request of the
papal legate, four of the guilty monks had been burnt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">{372}</a></span>
alive.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_654" id="Ref_654" href="#Foot_654">[654]</a></span>
Might not the same punishment be inflicted
on a monk of Orleans? They trembled at the very
thought. In vain, therefore, did the councillors of
parliament begin their inquiry; in vain did they go
from one house to another, and enter the rooms where
these reverend fathers were confined: the monks
were sullen, unfathomable, and more silent than the
ghost itself.</p>

<p>The judges determined to try what they could with
the novice who had acted the part of the ghost; but
if the monks were silent, sullen, and immovable, the
novice was agitated and frightened out of his senses.
The friars had uttered the most terrible threats; and
hence, when he was interrogated, 'he held firm,' says
the Geneva manuscript, 'fearing, if he spoke, that the
cordeliers would kill him.' The judges then reminded
him of the power of the parliament and the protection
of the king. 'You shall never return into the hands
of the monks,' they told him. At these words the poor
young fellow began to breathe; he recovered from his
great fright; his tongue was loosened, and he 'explained
the whole affair to the judges,' says Beza.
'I made a hole in the roof,' he said, 'to which I applied
my ear, to hear what the provincial said to me from
below. Then I struck a plank which I held in my
hand, and I hit it hard enough for the noise to be
heard by the reverend fathers underneath. That was
all the <i>fun</i>,' he added.</p>

<p class="side">=THEIR CONDEMNATION.=</p>

<p>The friars were then confronted with the novice,
who stoutly maintained the cheat got up by them.
They were both indignant and alarmed at seeing this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">{373}</a></span>
pitiful varlet turning against their reverences; but as
it was now impossible to deny the fact, they began to
protest against their judges, and to plead their privileges
once more. They were condemned; the indignation
was general, the king especially being greatly
irritated. All his life long he looked upon the monks,
black or white, as his personal enemies. Besides, the
hatred he felt against that lazy and ignorant herd was,
he thought, one of his attributes as the Father of
Letters. His anger broke out in the midst of his
court: 'I will pull down their convent!' he exclaimed,
'and build in its place a palace for the duke!' (that is,
for the Duke of Orleans, Catherine's husband). All
the councillors of parliament, both lay and clerical,
were assembled. The haughty Coliman, the eloquent
brother Stephen, and their accomplices were forced
to stand at the bar, and sentence was solemnly
delivered. They were to be taken to the Chatelet
prison at Orleans; there they would be stripped of
their frocks, be led into the cathedral, and then, set
on a platform with tapers in their hands, they were to
confess 'that, with certain fraud and deliberate malice,
they had plotted such wickedness.' Thence they were
to be taken to their convent, and afterwards to the
place of public execution, where they would again
confess their crime.</p>

<p>This promised the idlers of Orleans a still more
extraordinary spectacle than that given them when
the friars got into their carts. Every day they
expected to see the sentence carried out; but the
government feared to appear too favourable to the
Lutherans. The matter was protracted; some of the
monks died in prison; the others were suffered to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">{374}</a></span>
escape; and thus ended an affair which characterises
the epoch, and shows the weapons that a good many
priests used against the Reformation. If the sentence
was never executed, the moral influence of the story
was immense, and we shall presently see some of its
effects.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">FRANCIS PROPOSES A REFORMATION TO THE SORBONNE.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Autumn 1534.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="side">=FRANCIS CONFESSES HIS ERRORS.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE disgust inspired by the imposture of the cordeliers
of Orleans, and the jests lavished upon
the monks in the Louvre and throughout Paris, were
further encouragements to the king to prosecute his
alliances with protestantism. He had, however, little
need of a fresh incentive; the reform proposed by
Melanchthon was in his view acceptable and advantageous,
because it diminished the power of the pope,
and corrected abuses incompatible with the new light,
at the same time that it left untouched that catholicism
from which the king had no desire to secede. In his
private conversations with Du Bellay, Francis, laying
aside all reserve, acknowledged frankly that the
Romish Church was upon the wrong track, and said
in a confidential tone, that 'Luther was not so far
wrong as people said.' He did not fear to add that it
was himself rather who had been mistaken. The
King of France, and the country along with him, thus
appeared to be in a good way for reform.</p>

<p>Francis determined to acquaint the protestant
princes with his sentiments on Melanchthon's memoir.
'My envoy, on his return to Paris,' he wrote, 'having
laid before me the opinions of your doctors on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">{376}</a></span>
course to be pursued, I entertain a hope of seeing the
affairs of religion enter upon a fair way at last.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_655" id="Ref_655" href="#Foot_655">[655]</a></span>
Du Bellay, well satisfied on his part with the impression
made on his master by the opinions of the evangelical
divines, informed the magistrates of Augsburg, Ulm,
Nuremberg, Meiningen, and other imperial cities, that
the King of France approved of the Lutheran doctrines,
and would protect the protestants. The Melanchthonian
reformation was therefore in progress, and
already men were preparing the stones for the edifice
of the reformed Catholic Church. The French government
did not confine itself to writing letters; but,
strange to say! the sovereign, the absolute monarch,
did not fear to make an acknowledgment of his errors,
and to express his regret: he sent a thorough palinode
into Germany. He who was putting the Lutherans to
death was not far from declaring himself a Lutheran.
In October and November 1534, an agent from Francis
I. visited the cities of the Germanic empire, announcing
everywhere that 'the king now saw his
mistake in religious matters,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_656" id="Ref_656" href="#Foot_656">[656]</a></span>
and that the Germans
who followed Luther <i>thought correctly as regards the
faith that is in Christ</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_657" id="Ref_657" href="#Foot_657">[657]</a></span>
The worthy burgomasters and
councillors of Germany were amazed at such language,
and looked at one another with an incredulous air;
but the French envoy assured them repeatedly that
the King of France desired a reform even in his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">{377}</a></span>
country.... 'The emperor,' he added, 'wishes to constrain
the protestants by force of arms to keep to the
old doctrine; but the King of France will not permit
it. He has sent me into Germany to form an alliance
with you to that intent.' Such was the strange news
circulated beyond the Rhine. It reached the ears of
the Archbishop of Lunden, who immediately forwarded
it to Charles V.</p>

<p>When Francis I. annulled the pragmatic sanction
at the beginning of his reign, he had reserved the
right of appointing bishops, and had thus made the
Church subordinate to the State. The time seemed to
have arrived for taking a second step. It was necessary
to put an end to the popish superstitions and abuses,
condemned by the friends of letters, whose patron he
claimed to be, and thus satisfy the protestants; and,
by a wise reform, maintain in Europe the catholicity
of the Church, which the popes were about to destroy
by their incredible obstinacy. The king would thus
appear to be a better guardian of European catholicism
than even the pope, and secure for himself that European
preponderance which Charles V. had hitherto
possessed.</p>

<p class="side">=FRENCH VERSION OF THE ARTICLES.=</p>

<p>He must set his hand to the work and begin with
the clergy. The king, seeing that it would be unwise
to communicate to them unreservedly the opinions of
the reformers, as they had been read at the Louvre,
resolved to have a new edition of them prepared, which
should contain the essential ideas. It would appear
that he confided this task to a numerous commission.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_658" id="Ref_658" href="#Foot_658">[658]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">{378}</a></span>
William du Bellay and his brother the Bishop of
Paris were doubtless the two chief members. The
commissioners set to work, correcting, suppressing,
adding, hitting certain popular superstitions a little
harder even than the reformers, and at length they
prepared a memoir which may be considered as a
statement of what the French government meant by
the proposed reformation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_659" id="Ref_659" href="#Foot_659">[659]</a></span>
The changes made by
the French excited much discontent among the German
protestants, and Melanchthon himself complained
of them bitterly.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_660" id="Ref_660" href="#Foot_660">[660]</a></span></p>

<p>The king, who carried into every pursuit the courage
and fire of which he had given so many proofs on the
field of battle, appeared at first to attack the papacy
with the same resolution that he would have employed
in attacking one of Charles's armies. It must be
clearly remembered that, in his idea, the reform which
he was preparing carried with it the cessation of schism,
and that his plan would restore the catholicity torn to
pieces by Roman insolence and imprudence. This
remark, if duly weighed, justifies the king's boldness.
He sent the project to Rome, we are assured, asking
the pope to support or to amend it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_661" id="Ref_661" href="#Foot_661">[661]</a></span>
We may imagine
the alarm of the Vatican on reading this heretical
memoir. Then Du Bellay, taking the Sorbonne in
hand, had a conference with the deputies of that illustrious
body, whose whole influence was ever employed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">{379}</a></span>
in maintaining the factitious unity that characterises
the papacy. 'Gentlemen,' he said to them, 'by the
king's commands I have endeavoured to prevail upon
the German churches to moderate the doctrines on
which they separated from the Roman Church, wishing
thus to lead them back to union. By order, therefore, of
my master, I hand you the present articles, to receive
instruction from you as to what I shall have to say to
the German doctors.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_662" id="Ref_662" href="#Foot_662">[662]</a></span>
The deputies having received
the paper from Du Bellay, forwarded it to the sacred
faculty. The latter delegated to examine it 'eminent
men, doctors of experience in such matters,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_663" id="Ref_663" href="#Foot_663">[663]</a></span>
who immediately set to work.</p>

<p class="side">=TERROR OF THE SORBONNE.=</p>

<p>The secretary of the Sorbonne began to read the
articles: the doctors listened and soon began to look at
each other and ask if they had heard correctly. The
venerable committee was agitated like the surface of
the sea by a sudden squall. They knew Francis; they
knew he did not think there existed in his kingdom
any society daring enough to set limits to his power.
He expected that a word from his mouth would be
considered as a decree from God. The doctors came
to the conclusion, therefore, that if the king desired
such a reform, nothing in the world could prevent
him from establishing it. They saw the Church laid
waste, and Rome in ruins.... It was the beginning
of the end. Their terror and alarm increased every
minute. All the sacred faculty, all the Church must
rise and exclaim: 'Stop, Sire, or we perish!'</p>

<p>The French autocrat, however, took his precautions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">{380}</a></span>
and even while meditating how he could strip the pope
of his power, he put on a pleasant face, and ascribed to
others the blows aimed by his orders against Rome.
'They are <i>Melanchthonian</i> articles,' said his ministers.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_664" id="Ref_664" href="#Foot_664">[664]</a></span>
True, but behind Melanchthon was Du Bellay, and
behind him was the king. The tactics employed at
this moment by Francis I. are of all times; and if the
multitude is sometimes deceived, intelligent minds
have always recognised the thoughts of the supreme
mover under the pen of the humble secretary. The
movement of Francis towards independence is in no
respect surprising: the outburst is quite French if it
is not christian. There has always existed in France
a spirit of liberty so far as concerns the Church; and
the most pious kings, even St. Louis, have defended
the rights of their people against the holy see. The
Gallican liberties, although they are nothing more than
a dilapidated machine, are still a memorial of something;
and what is dilapidated to-day may be restored
to-morrow. It was therefore a truly French feeling,—it
was that hidden chord which vibrates at the
bottom of every generous heart, from the Channel to
the Mediterranean Sea, whose harmonious sound was
heard at this important period of the reign of Francis I.</p>

<p>The venerable company had some difficulty to recover
from their alarm. What! really, not in a dream,
not figuratively, heresy is at the gates of the Church
of France, introduced by the king ... who courteously
offers her his hand!... The terrified Sorbonne raised
a cry of horror, and mustered all their forces to prevent
the <i>heretic</i> from entering. They turned over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">{381}</a></span>
volumes of the doctors; they opposed the <i>Summa</i> of
St. Thomas to the Epistles of St. Paul; they sought
by every means in their power to defend stoutly the
scholastic doctrine in the presence of Francis. A fireship
had been launched by the guilty hand of the
king: did that prince imagine he would see the glorious
vessel, which had so long been mistress of the seas, in
a hurry to lower her flag? The crew were valiant,
determined upon a deadly resistance, and ready to
blow themselves into the air with the ship, rather than
capitulate. The struggle between the king and the
corporation was about to begin. Alas! Beda was no
longer there to support them, and recourse must be
had to others. 'Master Balue was elected to go to
court, carrying the registers, and Master Jacques Petit
was given him as his associate.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_665" id="Ref_665" href="#Foot_665">[665]</a></span>
The Sorbonne was
poor in resources: the strong men were in the camp
of Luther, Calvin, and Melanchthon.</p>

<p class="side">=THE MINISTERS AND THE SORBONNE.=</p>

<p>What was said at court between Master Balue,
Master Petit, and the King of France, has not been
recorded; but we have the memoir sent by the king to
the Sorbonne, and the answer returned by that body
to the king. These documents may enlighten us as
to what passed at the conference, and we shall allow
them to speak for themselves, arranging the former
under the name of the king's ministers. William du
Bellay, his brother the Bishop of Paris, and others
probably were the persons empowered by the king to
confer with Master Balue and Master Jacques Petit.
They were champions of very different causes—the
men who then met, probably at the Louvre, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">{382}</a></span>
presence of Francis I., and whom we are about to
hear.</p>

<h4><span class="smc">The King's Ministers.</span></h4>

<p>'To establish a real concord in the Church of God,

<h4><span class="smc">Ministers.</span></h4>

<p>'Above all things, let us remember that the doctors
of the Word of God ought not to fight like gladiators,
and defend all their opinions <i>mordicus</i> (tooth and

to one another ... without prejudice to truth.'</p>

<p>'Open your eyes, Sire; the Germans desire, in opposition

<h4><span class="smc">Ministers.</span></h4>

<p>'You are mistaken: important concessions have
been obtained. The Germans are of opinion that
bishops must hold the chief place among the ministers
of the Churches, and that a pontiff at Rome should
hold the first place among the bishops. But, on the

for consciences, consult their wants, and be ready to
concede to them some relaxation.'<span

<h4><span class="smc">Ministers.</span></h4>

<p>'Certain doctors of the Church, making use of a holy
prosopopœia, have introduced into their discourses
the saints whom they were eulogising, and have
prayed for their intercession as if they were present
before them;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_674" id="Ref_674" href="#Foot_674">[674]</a></span>
but they only desired by this means
to excite admiration for these godly persons, rather
than to obtain anything by their intercession.... Let
the people, then, be exhorted not to transfer to the
saints the confidence which is due to Jesus Christ
alone. It is Christ's will to be invoked and to answer
prayer.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_675" id="Ref_675" href="#Foot_675">[675]</a></span></p>

<p>Here the French mind indulged in a sly hit which
would not have occurred to the German mind; and
the king's councillors, determining to strike hard,
continued:</p>

<p>'What abuses and disorders have sprung out of
this worship of man! Observe the words, the songs,
the actions of the people on the saints' days, near their
graves or near their images! Mark the eagerness
with which the idle crowd hurries off to banquets,
games, dances, and quarrels. Watch the practices of
all those paltry, ignorant, greedy priests, who think of
nothing but putting money in their purses; and then
... tell us whether we do not in all these things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">{385}</a></span>
resemble pagans, and revive their shameful superstitions?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_676" id="Ref_676" href="#Foot_676">[676]</a></span></p>

<p>Not a word of this popular description of saints'
days will be found in Melanchthon's memoir: it is
entirely the work of Francis and his councillors.</p>

<h4><span class="smc">Sorbonne.</span></h4>

<p>'Let us beware how we forsake ancient customs.
Let us address our prayers directly to the saints who
are our patrons and intercessors under Jesus Christ.
To assert that they have not the prerogative of healing
diseases, is in opposition to your Majesty's personal
experience and the gift you have received from God of
curing the king's evil.... Let us also pay our devotions
to statues and images, since the seventh general council
commands them to be adored.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_677" id="Ref_677" href="#Foot_677">[677]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Sorbonne, in order to defend the prerogatives
of the saints, cited the miraculous powers
of the king, they employed an argument to which it
was dangerous to reply; and, accordingly, we find
nothing on this point in the answers of the opponents
of the faculty. The discussion, getting off this
shoal, turned to the act which is the essence of the
Romish doctrine, and priests were once more lashed
by the royal hand, which was even more skilful at
this work than in curing the evil.</p>

<h4><span class="smc">Ministers.</span></h4>

<p>'There ought to be in the Church a living communion

of the members of Christ.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_678" id="Ref_678" href="#Foot_678">[678]</a></span>
But, alas! what
do we find there? A crowd of ignorant and filthy
priests, the plague of society, a burden to the earth, a
slothful race who can do nothing but say mass, and
who, while saying it, do not even utter those five intelligible
words, preferable, as St. Paul thinks, to ten
thousand words in an unknown tongue.... We must
get rid of these mercenaries, these mass-mongers,
who have brought that holy ceremony into contempt,
and we must supply their place with holy, learned, and
experienced men.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_679" id="Ref_679" href="#Foot_679">[679]</a></span>
Then perhaps the Lord's Supper
will recover the esteem it has lost. Then, instead of
an unmeaning babble, we shall have psalms, and
hymns, and spiritual songs. Then we shall sing to
the Saviour, and every tongue will confess that Jesus
Christ is the Lord, to the glory of God the Father....
What false confidence, what wretched delusion is that
which leads so many souls to believe that by attending
mass every day, even when piety is neglected,
they are performing an act useful to themselves and
their friends, both for this life and for that which is to
come!'<span

<p class="side">=THE LORD'S SUPPER.=</p>

<p>The Sorbonne contended for the external mechanism
of the sacramental act, to which their opponents
desired to impart a spiritual and living character, and
defended without shame or scruple the material advantages
the clergy derived from it.

are paid.'<span

and that in this manner Christ remains in us and we

Lord's Supper, the Lord's bread and wine, mass,
eucharist, love-feast, or sacrifice, is of little moment.
Christians ought not to dispute about names, if they
possess the things; and, as the proverb says, "When

bread and the wine are truly changed in substance,
preserving only the accidents, and becoming the body
and blood of Christ. It is not true that the <i>panitas</i>
or <i>corporitas</i> of the bread combines with the <i>corporitas</i>
of Christ. The transubstantiation is effected <i>in instanti</i>
and not <i>successivè</i>; and it is certain that neither
laymen nor women can accomplish this miraculous act,
but priests only.'</p>

<p>'In this age, when everything is in a ferment,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_689" id="Ref_689" href="#Foot_689">[689]</a></span>
and when so many sects are raising their heads in various
places, the interest of the christian Church requires
that there should be an assembly composed not only
of priests and theologians, but also of laymen and
upright, sensible, courageous magistrates, who have
at heart the glory of the Lord, public morality, and
general usefulness.... Ah! it would be easy to agree
if we thought of Christ's glory rather than of our
own!'<span

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">{390}</a></div>

<p>The doctors of the Sorbonne had no great liking
for deliberative assemblies where they would sit with
laymen and even with heretics.</p>

<h4><span class="smc">Sorbonne.</span></h4>

<p>'Beware! ... it is to be feared that, under the
pretext of uniting with us, the heretics are conspiring
to lead the people astray.... Have we not seen such
assemblies in Germany, called together on a pretence
of concord, produce nothing but divisions, discord,
and infinite ruin of souls?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_691" id="Ref_691" href="#Foot_691">[691]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Sorbonne warned the king in vain. Francis
at this time, through policy no doubt, was opposed to
the doctrines maintained by the priests. He desired
to be freed at home from that papal supremacy which
presumed to direct the policy and religion of his
kingdom; and abroad he knew that a league with
England and Germany could alone destroy the overwhelming
preponderance of Charles V. And hence
the meetings of the Sorbonne grew more and more
agitated; the doctors repeated to one another all the
alarming reports they had heard; there was sorrow
and anger; never, they thought, had Roman-catholicism
in France been threatened with such terrible
danger. It was no longer a few obscure sects; no
longer a Brueys, a Henry of Lausanne, a Valdo,
Albigenses, or Waldenses, who attacked the Church:
no! powerful states, Germany and England, were separating
from the papacy, and the absolute monarch of
France was endeavouring to introduce revolutionary
principles into his kingdom. The Church, as its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">{391}</a></span>
Head had once been, was deserted by its friends.
The grandees who were subsequently to form a
league around the Guises, were silent now; the rough
and powerful Montmorency himself seemed dumb;
and, accordingly, agitation and alarm prevailed
in the corporation. Certain ultramontane fanatics
proposed petitioning the king to put down heresy
by force, and to uphold the Roman dogmas by
fire and sword. More moderate catholics, observing
with sorrow the catholicity so dear to them rent by
schism, sought for more rational means of restoring
the unity destroyed by the Reformation. Everybody
saw clearly that the enemy was at the gate, and that
no time must be lost in closing it.</p>

<p class="side">=DANGER OF CATHOLICISM.=</p>

<p>Alas! they had to deal with others besides heretics.
All reflecting minds in Europe, and especially in
France, were struck with the example set by the King
of England, and the members of the Roman party
thought that Francis was about to adopt the same
course in his kingdom. There was indeed a difference
between the systems of these two princes. Henry
desired the doctrine of Rome, but not its bishop;
Francis accepted the bishop, but rejected the doctrine.
Nevertheless, as each of these reforms was a heavy
blow aimed at the system of the middle ages, they
were looked upon as identical. The success which
Henry's plan had met with in England was an indication
of what Francis's plan would meet with in France.
The two monarchs who reigned on each side of the
Channel were equally absolute.</p>

<p>The Roman doctors, finding that their controversy
had not succeeded, resolved to go to work in a more
cunning way, and, without seeming to reject a union
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">{392}</a></span>
with Germany, to oppose the heretics by putting them
out of court. 'Sire,' they said to Francis, 'your very
humble servants and most obedient subjects of the
Faculty of Theology pray you to ask the Germans
whether they confess that the Church militant, whose
head (under Jesus) is Peter and his successors, is
infallible in faith and morals? whether they agree to
obey him as his subjects, and are willing to admit all
the books contained in the Bible,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_692" id="Ref_692" href="#Foot_692">[692]</a></span>
as well as the
decisions of the councils, popes, and doctors?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_693" id="Ref_693" href="#Foot_693">[693]</a></span>
Obedience to the pope and to tradition, without
discussing doctrines, was their summary of the controversy.
It did not succeed.</p>

<p class="side">=SHOULD KINGS FEAR PROTESTANTISM?=</p>

<p>The doctors of the faculty, finding that the king
would not aid them, applied to the papal nuncio.
They found him also a prey to fear. They began to
consult together on the best means of keeping France
in communion with the holy see. As Francis was
deaf to theological arguments, the Sorbonne and the
nuncio agreed that some other means must be
used. The prelate went to the Louvre, carrying with
him a suggestion which the Sorbonne had prompted.
'Sire,' he said, 'be not deceived. The protestants
will upset all civil as well as religious order.... The
throne is in as much danger as the altar.... The
introduction of a new religion must necessarily introduce
a new government.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_694" id="Ref_694" href="#Foot_694">[694]</a></span></p>

<p>That was indeed the best way of treating the affair;
the nuncio had found the joint in the armour, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">{393}</a></span>
king was for a moment staggered; but the pope's
conduct restored his confidence. Rome began to
proceed against Henry VIII. as she had formerly done
against kings in the middle ages. This proceeding, so
offensive to the royal dignity, drew Francis towards
the Reformation. If there is danger towards royal
power, it exists on both sides, he thought. He
believed even that the danger was greater on the side
of Rome than of Germany, since the protestants of
that country showed their princes the most loyal
submission, and the most religious and profound
respect. He had observed, that while the pope
desired to deprive the King of England of his states
and release his subjects from their obedience, the
reformation which that prince had carried out had
not prejudiced one of his rights; that there was a
talk, indeed, of insurrections against Henry VIII.,
but they were got up by Rome and her agents.
Enlightened men suggested to Francis, that while
popery kept the people in slavery, and caused insurrection
and rebellion against the throne, the Reformation
would secure order and obedience to kings, and
liberty to the people. He seems to have been convinced
... for the moment at least. 'England and I,'
he said, 'are accustomed to keep together and to
manage our affairs in harmony with each other, and
we shall continue to do so.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_695" id="Ref_695" href="#Foot_695">[695]</a></span></p>

<p>This new movement on the part of Francis emboldened
the evangelicals. They hoped that he would
go on to the end, and would not leave the pope even the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">{394}</a></span>
little place which he intended to reserve for him. If
a prince like Louis IX. maintained the rights of
the Gallican Church in the thirteenth century;
if a king like Charles VII. restored ecclesiastical
liberty in the fifteenth; shall we not see in this
universal revival of the sixteenth century a monarch
like Francis I. emancipating France from the Roman
yoke? At a great sacrifice he has just done much
for Wurtemberg, and will he do nothing for his own
kingdom? The friends of the Reformation encouraged
one another to entertain the brightest hopes. 'What
a noble position!' they said.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_696" id="Ref_696" href="#Foot_696">[696]</a></span>
Whenever they met,
whether in the university, in the country, or in
the town, they exchanged congratulations.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_697" id="Ref_697" href="#Foot_697">[697]</a></span>
In their opinion, old things had passed away.</p>

<p class="side">=UNEASINESS OF THE REFORMERS.=</p>

<p>But there were other evangelicals—men more decided
and more scriptural—who looked with a distrustful
eye upon these mysterious conferences between
Francis and the protestants of Germany. Those fine
speeches of Du Bellay, and that remarkable conference
at Bar-le-Duc, were in their eyes policy and diplomacy,
but not religion. They felt uneasy and alarmed; and
when they met to pray in their obscure conventicles,
these humble christians said to one another with terror:
'Satan is casting his net to catch those who are not on
the watch. Let us examine the colours in which he
is disguised.' Astonished and even distressed, they
asked if it was not strange to assert, as Melanchthon
had done, 'that no good man would protest against
the monarchy of the Roman bishop,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_698" id="Ref_698" href="#Foot_698">[698]</a></span>
and that, in consideration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">{395}</a></span>
of certain reforms, we should hasten to recognise
him!' No, the Roman episcopate will never be
reformed, they said. Remodel it as you like, it will
always betray its domineering spirit, revive its ancient
tricks, and regain its ascendency, even by fire. We
must be on our guard.... Between Rome and the
Reformation it is a matter of mere yes or no: the pope
or Jesus Christ! Unable to conquer the new Church
in fair fight, they hope to strangle it in their embraces.
Delilah will lull to sleep in her lap the prophet whom
the strong men have been unable to bind with green
withes and new ropes. Under the pretence of screening
the Reform from evil influences, they desire to
set it, like a flower of the field, in some place without
light and air, where, fading and pining away ... it
will perish. Thanks to the protection of the Queen of
Navarre, the gallant and high-spirited charger that
loved to sport in the meadows is about to be taken to
the king's stable, where it will be adorned with a
magnificent harness ... but its mouth will be deformed
by the bit, its flanks torn by the spur, and
even the plaits of its mane will bear witness to its
degradation.</p>

<p>This future was not reserved for the Reform.
While the mild and prudent voices of Melanchthon
and Bucer were soothing it to sleep, innocently enough
no doubt, bolder and freer voices, those of a Farel and
a Calvin, were preparing to arouse it. While the papers
of the conciliating theologians were lying on the velvet
cover of the royal table, another paper, whose lines of
fire seemed penned by the thunderbolt, was about to
circulate through the kingdom, and be posted even at
the door of the king's chamber by a too daring hand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">{396}</a></span>
which was to arouse in that prince one of the most terrible
bursts of passion ever recorded in history. A loud
peal of thunder would be heard, and the heavy atmosphere
which stifled men's minds would be followed
by a pure and reviving air. There would be furious
tempests; but the christians of the scriptural, practical,
and radical Reformation rejoiced at witnessing the
failure of this specious but impossible project, which
aimed at reforming the Church even while preserving
Roman-catholicism. The system of the Queen of
Navarre will have to be abandoned; that of Calvin
will prevail. To uphold truth, the evangelicals were
about to sacrifice unity. No doubt furious persecutions
would be the consequence, but they said to each other
that it was better to live in the midst of hurricanes that
awaken, than in mephitic vapours which lull men into
the sleep of death.</p>

<p>We shall describe hereafter the event which had so
notable an influence on the destinies of the Reformation
in France. They were Frenchmen who caused
it; it was a Frenchman who was the principal author;
but it was from Switzerland, as we shall see, that this
formidable blow was to come, and to that country we
must now return.</p>

 <span style="font-size:80%">THE RENAISSANCE, THE REFORMATION, THE MIDDLE AGES.<br />
 (1526.)</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Reformation was necessary to christian society.
The Renaissance, daughter alike of ancient and
of modern Rome, was a movement of revival, and yet
it carried with it a principle of death, so that wherever
it was not transformed by heavenly forces, it fell away
and became corrupted. The influence of the humanists—of
such men as Erasmus, Sir Thomas More, and
afterwards of Montaigne—was a balmy gale that shed
its odours on the upper classes, but exerted no power
over the lower ranks of the people. In the elegant
compositions of the men of letters, there was nothing
for the conscience, that divinely appointed force of the
human race. The work of the Renaissance, had it
stood alone, must of necessity, therefore, have ended
in failure and death. There are persons in these days
who think otherwise: they believe that a new state of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">{398}</a></span>
society would have arisen without the Reformation,
and that political liberty would have renewed the
world better than the Gospel. This is assuredly a
great error. At that time liberty had scarcely any
existence in Europe, and even had it existed, and the
dominion of conscience not reappeared along with
it, it is certain that, though powerful enough, perhaps,
to destroy the old elements of order prevailing in
society, it would have been unable to substitute any
better elements in their place. If, even in the nineteenth
century, we tremble sometimes when we hear the distant
explosions of liberty, what must have been the
feeling in the sixteenth? The men who were about to
appear on the theatre of the world were still immersed
in disorder and barbarism. Everything betokened
great virtues in the new generation, but also tumultuous
passions; a divine heroism, but also gigantic
crimes; a mighty energy, but at its side a languishing
insensibility. A renewed society could not be constituted
out of such elements. It wanted the divine
breath to inspire high thoughts, and the hand of God to
establish everywhere the providential order.</p>

<p>At the end of the fifteenth and the beginning of the
sixteenth century, society was in a state of excitement.
The world was in suspense, as when the statuary
is about to create a work that shall be the object of
universal admiration. The metal is melted, the mass
flows from the furnace like glowing brass; but the
approaching lava alarms, and not without reason, the
anxious spectators. At this period we witness struggles,
insurrections, and reaction. The perfumed spirit of
the Renaissance was unable to check the evil and to
establish order and liberty. Society had appeared to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">{399}</a></span>
grow young again under the breath of antiquity;
but wherever a knowledge of the Gospel was not
combined with the cultivation of letters, that purity,
boldness, and elevation of youth, which at first had
charmed contemporaries, disappeared. The melting
was checked, the metal grew cold, and instead of the
masterpiece that had been expected, there appeared
the repulsive forms of servility, immorality, and superstition.</p>

<p class="side">=CRISIS AND MEANS OF SALVATION.=</p>

<p>Was there any means of preventing so fatal a future?
How, in the midst of the old society, which was
crumbling to pieces, could a new one be formed, with
any certain prospect of vitality? In religion only
the coming age was to find its living force. If the
conscience of man was awakened and sanctified by
christianity, then and then only the world would
stand.</p>

<p>Was it possible to look for this regenerating element
in the society which was expiring? That would be
to search among the dead for the principle of life. It
was necessary to have recourse to the primitive sources
of faith. The Gospel, more human than literature,
more divine than philosophy, exerts an influence over
man that these two things cannot possess. It goes
down into the depths—that is, into the people—which
the Renaissance had not done; it rises towards the
high places—that is, towards heaven—which philosophy
cannot do. When the Gospel lifted up its
voice in the days of the Reformation, the people
listened. It spoke to them of God, sin, condemnation,
pardon, everlasting life—in a word, of Christ.
The human soul discovered that this was what it
wanted; and was touched, captivated, and finally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">{400}</a></span>
renewed. The movement was all the more powerful
because the doctrine preached to the people had
nothing to do with animosities, traditions, interests of
race, dynasties, or courts. True, it got mixed up
with these things afterwards; but in the beginning it
was simply the voice of God upon earth. It circulated
a purifying fire through corrupted society, and
the new world was formed.</p>

<p>The old society, whose place was about to be occupied,
did all in its power to resist the light. A terrible
voice issued from the Vatican; a hand of iron
executed its behests in many a country, and strangled
the new life in its cradle. Spain, Italy, Austria, and
France were the chief theatres of the deplorable tragedies,
whose heroes were Philip II. and the Guises.
But there were souls, we may even say nations, protected
by the hand of God, who have been ever since
like trees whose leaves never wither.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_699" id="Ref_699" href="#Foot_699">[699]</a></span>
Intelligent
men, struck by their greatness, have been alarmed for
the nations that are not watered by the same rivers.
Against such a danger there is, however, a sure remedy;
it is that all people should come and drink at those
fountains of life which have given protestant nations
'all the attributes of civilisation and power.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_700" id="Ref_700" href="#Foot_700">[700]</a></span>
Or do
they perchance imagine that by shutting their windows
against the sun, the light will spread more widely?...
A new era is beginning, and all lingering nations
are now invited to the great renovation of which the
Gospel is the divine and mighty organ.</p>

<p class="side">=NEW SITUATION OF GENEVA.=</p>

<p>In 1526 Geneva was in a position which permitted
it to receive the new seed of the new society. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">{401}</a></span>
alliance with the cantons, by drawing that city nearer
to Switzerland, facilitated the arrival of the intrepid
husbandmen who brought with them the seeds of life.
At Wittemberg, at Zurich, and even in the upper extremities
of Lake Leman, in those beautiful valleys
of the Rhone and the Alps which Farel had evangelised,
the divine sun had poured down his first rays.
When the Genevans made their alliance with the Swiss,
they had only thought of finding a support to their
national existence; but they had effected more: they
had opened the gates of day, and were about to
receive a light which, while securing their liberties,
would guide their souls along the path of eternal life.
The city was thus to acquire an influence of which
none of its children had ever dreamt, and by the instrumentality
of Calvin, one of the noblest spirits that
ever lived, 'she was about to become the rival of
Rome,' as an historian says (perhaps with a little
exaggeration), 'and wrest from her the dominion of
half the christian world.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_701" id="Ref_701" href="#Foot_701">[701]</a></span></p>

<p>If the alliance with the cantons opened Geneva on
the side of Switzerland, it raised a wall of separation
between that city and Savoy—which was not less
necessary for the part she was called upon to play in
the sixteenth century. The valley of the Leman was
at that time dotted with châteaux, whose ruins may
still be seen here and there. As invasion, pillage, and
murder formed part of social life in the middle ages,
the nobles surrounded their houses with walls, and
some even built their dwelling-places on the mountains.
From Geneva might be descried the castle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">{402}</a></span>
Monnetier standing on immense perpendicular rocks
on Mont Salève....</p>

</div>

<p>Further on, and near Thonon, on an isolated hill,
shaded by luxuriant chestnut trees, stood the vast
castle of Allinges, which is still a noble ruin. The
lords of these places, energetic, rude, freebooting, and
often cruel men, growing weary of their isolation
and their idleness, would collect their followers,
lower their drawbridges, rush into the high roads in
search of adventures, and indulge in a life of raids and
plunder, violence and murder.</p>

<p>The towns, with their traders and travellers, were
especially the abhorrence of these gentlemen robbers.
From the tenth century the Genevan travellers and
foreign merchants, passing through Geneva with their
goods, often fell a prey to the plundering vagabondage
of the neighbouring lords. This was not without
important consequences for civilisation and liberty.
Seeing the nobles perpetually in insurrection against
social order, the burghers learnt to revolt against
despotism, murder, and robbery. Geneva received
one of these lessons, and profited by it better than
others.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_703" id="Ref_703" href="#Foot_703">[703]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=PONTVERRE AND THE SAVOYARD NOBLES.=</p>

<p>In all the castles of Genevois, Chablais, and the
Pays de Vaud, it was said, in 1526, that the alliance
of Geneva with the free Swiss cantons menaced the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">{403}</a></span>
rights of Savoy, the temporal (and even the spiritual)
power of the bishop, and Roman-catholicism. And
hence the irritated nobles ruminated in their strongholds
upon the means of destroying the union, or at
least of neutralising its effects. François de Ternier,
seigneur of Pontverre, whose domains were situated
between Mont Salève and the Rhone, about a league
from Geneva, thought of nothing else night or day.
A noble, upright, but violent man; a fanatical enemy
of the burgher class, of liberty, and of the Reformation;
and a representative of the middle ages, he swore
to combat the Swiss alliance unto death, and he kept
his oath. Owing to the energy of his character and
the nobility of his house, François possessed great
influence among his neighbours. One day, after long
meditation over his plans, he left his residence, attended
by a few horsemen, and visited the neighbouring
castles. While seated at table with the knights, he
made his apprehensions known to them, and conjured
them to oppose the accursed alliance. He asked them
whether it was for nothing that the privilege of bearing
arms had been given to the nobles. 'Let us make
haste,' he said, 'and crush a new and daring power
that threatens to destroy our castles and our churches.'
He sounded the alarm everywhere; he reminded the
nobles that they had a right to make war whenever
they pleased;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_704" id="Ref_704" href="#Foot_704">[704]</a></span>
and forthwith many lords responded to
his energetic appeals. They armed themselves, and,
issuing from their strongholds, covered the district
around Geneva like a cloud of locusts. Caring little
for the political or religious ideas with which Pontverre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">{404}</a></span>
was animated, they sought amusement, plunder,
and the gratification of their hatred against the citizens.
They were observed at a distance, with their mounted
followers, on the high roads, and they were not idle.
They allowed nobody to enter the city, and carried off
property, provisions, and cattle. The peasants and the
Genevan merchants, so disgracefully plundered, asked
each other if the tottering episcopal throne was to be
upheld by <i>banditti</i>.... 'If you return,' said these noble
highwaymen, 'we will <i>hang you up by the neck</i>.' Nor
was that all: several nobles, whose castles were near the
water, resorted to piracy on the lake: they pillaged the
country-houses near the shore, imprisoned the men,
insulted the women, and cut off all communication
with Switzerland.</p>

<p class="side">=NOBLES TURN HIGHWAYMEN.=</p>

<p>One difficulty, however, occurred to these noble
robbers: they chanced to maltreat, without their
knowing it, some of their own party, who were
coming from German Switzerland. Having been
much reproached for this, they took counsel on the
road: 'What must we do,' they asked, 'to distinguish
the Genevans?' They hit upon a curious shibboleth.
As soon as they caught sight of any travellers in the
distance, they spurred their horses, galloped up, and
put some ordinary question to the strangers, 'examining
in this way all who passed to and fro.' If the
travellers replied in French, the language of Geneva,
the knightly highwaymen declared they were <i>huguenots</i>,
and immediately carried them off, goods and
all. If the victims complained, they were not listened
to; and even when they came from the banks
of the Loire and the Seine, they were taken and shut
up in the nearest castle. Many messengers from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">{405}</a></span>
France to the Swiss cantons, who spoke like the
Genevans, were arrested in this way.</p>

<p>France, Berne, and Geneva complained bitterly;
but the lords (for the most part Savoyards) took no
notice of it. By chastising these burghers, they believed
they were gaining heaven. They laughed
among themselves at the universal complaints, and
added sarcasm to cruelty. One day a Genevan
deputy having appeared before Pontverre, to protest
against such brigandage, the haughty noble replied
coldly: 'Tell those who sent you, that in a fortnight
I will come and set fire to the four corners of your
city.' Another day, De la Fontaine, a retired syndic
and mameluke, as he was riding along the high road,
met a huguenot, and said to him: 'Go and tell your
friends that we are coming to Geneva shortly, and
will throw all the citizens into the Rhone.' As the
Genevan walked away, the mameluke called him
back: 'Wait a moment,' he said, and then continued
maliciously: 'No, I think it will be better to cut off
their heads, in order to multiply the relics.' This
was an allusion to Berthelier's head, which had been
solemnly buried. In the noisy banquets which these
nobles gave each other in their châteaux, they related
their feats of arms: anecdotes akin to those just
quoted followed each other amid roars of laughter:
the subject was inexhaustible. The politicians, although
more moderate in appearance, were not less
decided. They meditated over the matter in cold
blood. 'I will enter Geneva sword in hand,' said
the Count of Genevois, the duke's brother, 'and will
take away six score of the most rebellious patriots.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_705" id="Ref_705" href="#Foot_705">[705]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">{406}</a></div>

<p>Thus the middle ages seemed to be rising in defence
of their rights. The temporal and spiritual authority
of the bishop-prince was protected by bands of highwaymen.
But while these powers, which pretended
to be legitimate, employed robbery, violence, and
murder, the friends of liberty prepared to defend
themselves lawfully and to fight honourably, like regular
troops. Besançon Hugues, reelected captain-general
three days after the alliance with the Swiss,
gave the signal. Instantly the citizens began to
practise the use of arms in the city; and in the
country, where they were placed as outposts, they
kept strict watch over all the movements of the
gentlemen robbers. Fearing that the latter, to crown
their brigandage, would march against Geneva, the
syndics had iron gratings put to all the windows in
the city walls, built up three of the gates, placed a
guard at the others, and stretched chains across
every street. At the same time they brought into
the harbour all the boats that had escaped the piratical
incursions of the nobles, placed a sentry on the belfry
of St. Pierre, and ordered that the city should be
lighted all the night long. This little people rose
like one man, and all were ready to give their lives
to protect their goods and trade, their wives and
children, and to save their old liberties and their new
aspirations.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_706" id="Ref_706" href="#Foot_706">[706]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=GENEVAN DEPUTATION TO BERNE.=</p>

<p>While thus resolute against their enemies in arms,
the citizens showed moderation towards their disarmed
foes. Some of those who were most exasperated,
wishing to take their revenge, asked permission to
<i>forage</i>, that is, to seize the property of the disloyal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">{407}</a></span>
and fugitive mamelukes. 'It is perfectly fair,' they
said, 'for their treason and brigandage have reduced
Geneva to extreme misery: we shall only get back
what they have taken from us.' But Hugues, the
friend of order as well as of liberty, made answer:
'Let us commence proceedings against the accused;
let us condemn them in penalties more or less severe;
but let us refrain from violence, even though we have
the appearance of right in our favour.'—'The ducal
faction,' replied these hot-headed men, 'not only
plundered us, but conspired against the city, and
took part in the tortures and murders inflicted upon
the citizens.' The syndics were not convinced, and
the property of the offenders was respected; but after
a rigorous investigation, they were deprived of the
rights of citizenship.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_707" id="Ref_707" href="#Foot_707">[707]</a></span></p>

<p>The Swiss cantons, discontented because the Genevans,
who were in great straits, had not repaid the
expenses incurred on their behalf, asked more for the
mamelukes than the council granted: they demanded
that they should all be allowed to return to the city.
But to receive those who were making war against
them, seemed impossible to the Genevans. They sent
two good huguenots to Berne, François Favre and
Baudichon de la Maison-Neuve, to make representations
in this matter. The deputies were admitted to
the great council on the 5th of June, 1526. De Lullins,
the Savoyard governor, was also received on the same
day, and in the duke's name he made great complaints
against Geneva. Favre, a quick, impatient, passionate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">{408}</a></span>
man, replied in <i>coarse terms</i>. The Bernese firmly adhered
to their resolution, and reprimanded the Genevan
deputy, who candidly acknowledged his fault: 'Yes,'
he said, 'I am <i>too warm</i>; but I answered rather as a
private individual than as an ambassador.' On returning
to his inn, he thought that the payment of the sum
claimed by the Bernese would settle everything, and
the same day he wrote to the council of Geneva: 'Your
humble servant begs to inform you that you must send
the money promised to my lords of Berne. Otherwise,
let him fly from the city who can! Do you
think you can promise and not be bound to keep your
word? Find the money, or you are lost. I pray you
warn my wife, that she may come to Lausanne. I am
serving at my own expense, and yet I must pay for
others also. Do not ruin a noble cause for such a
trifle. If Berne is satisfied, we shall be all right with
the mamelukes.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_708" id="Ref_708" href="#Foot_708">[708]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CARTELIER'S CONDEMNATION.=</p>

<p>Robber nobles were not the only supporters of the
middle ages. That epoch has had its great men, but
at the time of its fall it had but sorry representatives.
The knights of the highway had their companions in
the intriguers of the city. Among the latter we may include
Cartelier, who had played his part in the plots got
up to deliver Geneva to Savoy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_709" id="Ref_709" href="#Foot_709">[709]</a></span>
This man, who hated
independence and the Reformation even more than
Pontverre did, was, through the anger of the citizens
and the avarice of the bishop, to suffer for the crimes
of which his party was guilty. Being utterly devoid of
shame, he went up and down the city as if he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">{409}</a></span>
nothing to fear, and when he chanced to meet the indignant
glance of a huguenot, he braved the anger with
which he was threatened by assuming an air of contempt
and defiance. Rich, clever, but of low character, he
had contrived to be made a citizen in order to indulge in
the most perfidious intrigues. One day he was apprehended,
notwithstanding his insolent airs, and put into
prison. A thrill ran through all the city, as if the hand
of God had been seen striking that great criminal. Amblarde,
Berthelier's widow, and his two children; John,
Lévrier's brother; and a hundred citizens who had all
just cause of complaint against the wretch, appeared
before the council, and called for justice with cries
and tears: 'He has spilt the blood of our fathers, our
brothers, and our husbands,' said the excited crowd.
'He wished to destroy our independence and subject us
to the duke.' Convicted of conspiring against the State,
the wretch was condemned to death. The executioner,
putting a rope round his neck, led him through the
city, followed by an immense crowd. The indignant
people were delighted when they saw the rich and
powerful stranger reduced to such humiliation. Proud
and pitiless, he had plotted to ruin the city, and now
he was expiating his crimes. Things did not stop here:
while moderate men desired to remain in the paths of
justice, the more hot-headed of the party of independence
<i>derided</i> him, says a chronicler, and some mischievous
boys pelted him with mud. The unhappy
man, whose fall had been so great, thus arrived at the
place of execution, and the hangman prepared to perform
his duty.</p>

<p>Cartelier had but a few minutes more to live, when
the bishop's steward was seen hurrying forward with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">{410}</a></span>
letters of grace, commuting the capital punishment
into a fine of six thousand golden crowns payable to
the prelate and to the city. To spare the life of the
wretched man might have been an act of mercy and
equity, especially as his crimes were political; but the
angry youths who surrounded the criminal ascribed the
bishop's clemency to his covetousness and to the hatred
he bore the cause of independence. They desired the
execution of the condemned man. Twice the hangman
removed the rope, and twice these exasperated
young men replaced it round Cartelier's neck. They
yielded at last, however, and were satisfied with having
made the conspirator feel all the anguish of death.
Cartelier was set at liberty. When the bishop was
informed of what had happened, he became afraid,
imagining his authority compromised and his power
endangered. 'It was for good reasons,' he wrote to
the syndics, 'that I pardoned Cartelier; however,
write and tell me if the people are inclined to revolt
on account of this pardon.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_710" id="Ref_710" href="#Foot_710">[710]</a></span>
The people did not
revolt, and the rich culprit, having paid the fine,
retired quietly to Bourg in Bresse, whence he had
come.</p>

<p class="side">=THE BISHOP'S HESITATION.=</p>

<p>The bishop, who had first sentenced, then pardoned,
and then repented of his pardon, was continually hesitating,
and did not know what party to side with. He
was not devoted body and soul to the duke, like his
predecessor. Placed between the Savoyards and the
huguenots, he was at heart, equally afraid of both, and
by turns flung himself into the arms of opposite parties.
He was like a stag between two packs of hounds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">{411}</a></span>
always afraid and panting. 'I write <i>angrily</i>,' he says
in his letters: he was, indeed, always angry with one
party or the other. Even the canons, his natural
friends, and the members of his council aroused his
fears, and not without cause; for these reverend persons
had no confidence either in the bishop's character or in
the brigandage of the gentry of the neighbourhood.
Messieurs De Lutry, De Montrotier, De Lucinge, De
St. Martin, and other canons said that the temporal authority
of the prelate was too weak to maintain order;
that the sword of a secular prince was wanted, and at
the bottom of their hearts they called for the duke.
'Ah!' said La Baume to Hugues, 'the chapter is a
<i>poisoned</i> body;' he called the canons thieves and
robbers: <i>Ille fur et latro est</i>, he said of one of them.
The episcopal office appeared a heavy burden to him;
but it put him in a position to give good dinners to his
friends, and that was one of the most important duties
of his life. 'I have wine for the winter,' he wrote in a
postscript to the letter in which he made these complaints,
'and plenty to entertain you with.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_711" id="Ref_711" href="#Foot_711">[711]</a></span>
Such were his episcopal consolations.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">THE GOSPEL AT GENEVA, AND THE SACK OF ROME.<br />
 (<span class="smc">January to June 1527.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE bishop was about to have enemies more formidable
than the duke and the League. The
Reformation was approaching. There is a characteristic
trait in the history of Geneva; the several surrounding
countries were by turns to scatter the seeds
of life in that city; in it was to be heard a concert of
voices from France, Italy, and German Switzerland.
It was the last of these that began.</p>

<p class="side">=LAYMEN AND CLERGY.=</p>

<p>At the time when treason was expelled from the
city in the person of Cartelier, the Gospel entered it
in that of an honest Helvetian, one of the Bernese
and Friburg deputies who went there in 1527 about
the affairs of the alliance concluded in 1526. Friburg
would not have permitted a heretic preacher to accompany
the deputation; even Berne would not have desired
it just yet; but one of the Bernese ambassadors,
a pious layman, who was coming to give a valuable
support to national independence, was to call the
Genevese to spiritual liberty. The lay members of
the Church occupied in the time of the apostles, as
is well known, a marked station in the religious community;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_712" id="Ref_712" href="#Foot_712">[712]</a></span>
but by degrees the dominion of the clergy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">{413}</a></span>
had been substituted for evangelical liberty. One of
the principal causes of this revolution was the inferiority
of the laity; for many centuries ecclesiastics
were the only educated men. But if this state of
things should change, if the laity should attain to
more knowledge and more energy than the clergy,
a new revolution would be effected in an opposite
direction. And this is really what happened in the
sixteenth century. The christian layman who then
arrived at Geneva was Thomas ab Hofen, a friend
of Zwingle, whom we have already mentioned.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_713" id="Ref_713" href="#Foot_713">[713]</a></span>
In the year 1524 he had declared at Berne in favour of
the Reformation. The Zurich doctor, hearing of
his departure for the shores of Lake Leman, was rejoiced,
for the piercing eye of his faith had fancied it
could perceive a ray of evangelical light breaking over
those distant hills. He desired that the Genevans,
now united to Switzerland, should find in her not only
liberty but truth. 'Undoubtedly,' wrote Zwingle
to the excellent Bernese, 'undoubtedly this mission
may be of extraordinary advantage to the citizens of
Geneva, who have been so recently received into alliance
with the cantons.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_714" id="Ref_714" href="#Foot_714">[714]</a></span></p>

<p>Ab Hofen did not go to Geneva with the intention
of reforming it; his mission was diplomatic; but he
was one of that 'chosen generation' of whom St. Peter
speaks—one of those christians who are always ready
to 'show forth the praises of Him who has called them
to his marvellous light.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_715" id="Ref_715" href="#Foot_715">[715]</a></span>
As he entered the city, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">{414}</a></span>
said to himself that he would do with earnestness
whatever work God might set before him, as his
Zurich friend had prayed him. Simple-minded,
moderate, and sensitive, Ab Hofen placed the kingdom
of heaven above the things of the earth; but he
was subject to fits of melancholy, which occasionally
made him faint-hearted. When he arrived at Geneva,
he visited many citizens, attended the churches and
the meetings of the people, and, having reflected upon
everything, he thought to himself that there was much
patriotism in the city, but unfortunately little christianity,
and that religion was the weak side of Genevan
emancipation. He was distressed, for he had expected
better things. With a heart overflowing with
sorrow he returned to his inn (17th of January, 1527),
and feeling the necessity of unburdening himself on
the bosom of a friend, he sat down and wrote to the
great reformer of Zurich: 'The number of those who
confess the doctrine of the Gospel must be increased.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_716" id="Ref_716" href="#Foot_716">[716]</a></span>
There were, therefore, at this time in Geneva christians
who confessed salvation by Jesus Christ, and not
by the ceremonies of the Church; but their number
was not large.</p>

<p class="side">=AB HOFEN'S CHRISTIAN CONVERSATION.=</p>

<p>Ab Hofen determined to do his best to remedy this
evil. He had a loving heart and practical mind, and
with indefatigable zeal took advantage of every moment
of leisure spared him by his official duties. As
soon, therefore, as a conference with the Genevan magistrates
was ended, or a despatch to the Bernese government
finished, he laid aside his diplomatic character and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">{415}</a></span>
began to visit the citizens, conversing with them, and
telling them of what was going on at Zurich and preparing
at Berne. Being received into the families of some of
the principal huguenots, and seated with them round
the hearth, at the severest portion of the year (January
1527), he spoke to them of the Word of God, of its
authority, superior (he said) to the pope's, and of the
salvation which it proclaimed. He taught them that
in the Gospel God gives man full remission of his
sins. These doctrines, unknown for so many ages,
and subversive of the legal and ceremonial religion of
Rome, were heard at Geneva with astonishment and
pleasure.</p>

<p>At first the priests received the evangelist magistrate
rather favourably. The rank which he bore
made him honourable in their eyes; and he, far from
being rude towards them, like certain huguenots, was
amiable and sympathising. Some ecclesiastics, believing
him to belong to their coterie, because he
spoke of religion, did not conceal their uneasiness
from him, and described to him, very innocently, the
fine times when presents of bread, wine, oil, game,
and tapers were plentiful in their kitchen, and when
they used to say, with a gracious tone, to the believers
who brought these donations in white napkins:
<i>Centuplum accipietis et vitam æternam possidebitis</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_717" id="Ref_717" href="#Foot_717">[717]</a></span>
Then they added, with loud complaints: 'Alas! the
faithful bring us no more offerings, and people do not
run so ardently after indulgences as they used to do.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_718" id="Ref_718" href="#Foot_718">[718]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">{416}</a></div>

<p>The Bernese envoy, inwardly delighted at these
candid avowals, which he did not fail to transmit to
Zwingle, apparently avoided all controversy, and continued
to announce the simple Gospel. The citizens
listened to him; they sought his company, and invited
him to take a seat in their family circle, or in some
huguenot assembly, and to speak of the noble things
that were doing at Zurich. These successes encouraged
him: his eyes sparkled, he accosted the
citizens freely, and his words flowed copiously from
his lips. 'I will not cease proclaiming the Gospel,'
he wrote to Zwingle; 'all my strength shall be devoted
to it.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_719" id="Ref_719" href="#Foot_719">[719]</a></span>
Erelong the well-disposed men who had
gathered round him were joined by other citizens,
exclusively friends of liberty; they listened to him
with interest; but when he began to blame certain
excesses, and to require certain moral reforms, he met
with coldness and even determined opposition from
them, and they turned their backs on him. Ab
Hofen, although a man of zeal and piety, did not
possess the faith which moves mountains; he returned
dispirited to his inn, shut himself up in his room, and,
heaving deep sighs, wrote all his trouble to Zwingle.
The latter, who possessed a sure glance, saw that
the opportunity was unique. To establish the Reformation
at the two extremities of Switzerland,
at Zurich and Geneva, appeared to him a most
important work. Would not these two arms, as
they drew together, drag all Switzerland with them,
especially if the powerful Berne lent its support in
the centre? But he knew Ab Hofen, and fearing his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">{417}</a></span>
dejection, he wrote to him: 'Take care that the work
so well begun is not stopped. While transacting the
business of the republic, do not neglect the business
of Jesus Christ.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_720" id="Ref_720" href="#Foot_720">[720]</a></span>
 You will deserve well of the citizens
of Geneva if you put in order not only their laws
and their rights, but their souls also.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_721" id="Ref_721" href="#Foot_721">[721]</a></span>
Now what can
put the soul in order except it be the Word and the
teaching of Him who created the soul?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_722" id="Ref_722" href="#Foot_722">[722]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=ZWINGLE ENCOURAGES AB HOFEN.=</p>

<p>Zwingle went further than this, and, in order to
revive Ab Hofen's fainting heart, made use of an
argument to which the politician could not be insensible.
The reformer of Zurich was the friend of
liberty as well as of the Gospel, and he believed that
a people could be governed in only one of two ways:
either by the Bible or by the sword, by the fear of
God or by the fear of man. In his opinion Geneva
could protect her independence against the attacks of
Savoy, France, and all foreign powers, only by submitting
to the King of heaven. 'O my dear Thomas,'
he wrote to his friend, 'there is nothing I desire so
much as to see the doctrine of the Gospel flourishing
in that republic (Geneva). Wherever that doctrine
triumphs, the boldness of tyrants is restrained.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_723" id="Ref_723" href="#Foot_723">[723]</a></span>
At the same time, not wishing to offend the Bernese
deputy, Zwingle added: 'If I write these things, it is
not to awaken one who sleeps, but to encourage one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">{418}</a></span>
who runs.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_724" id="Ref_724" href="#Foot_724">[724]</a></span>
He ended his letter with a fraternal
salutation to the evangelical christians of Geneva:
'Salute them all in my name,' he said.</p>

<p>Ab Hofen was not insensible to this appeal; if he
was easily cast down, he was as easily lifted up. He
therefore redoubled his zeal, and pressed Geneva to
imitate Zurich and Berne; but he perceived that his
evangelical exertions were appreciated by a very small
number only, and regarded with coldness, and even
with displeasure and contempt, by the majority of
politicians. Citizens, who had at first given him the
warmest welcome, scarcely saluted him when he met
them, and if he went to any meeting his presence
put a restraint upon the whole assembly. He soon
encountered opposition of a more hostile nature; the
priests eyed him angrily, and the confidence which
some ecclesiastics had placed in him was succeeded by
a violent hatred. The clergy proclaimed a general
crusade against heresy; the canons put themselves at
the head of the opposition; priests and monks filled
the streets, going from house to house, and bade
the citizens be on their guard against the evangelical
addresses of the Bernese envoy. They cried down,
abused, and anathematised the doctrines he taught,
and made war against the New Testament wherever
they found it. They encouraged one another, and
frightened the women especially. According to their
representations, the city would be ruined if it listened
to the heretical diplomatist.</p>

<p class="side">=AB HOFEN'S INFLUENCE AND DEATH.=</p>

<p>Ab Hofen now fell into a state of discouragement
more serious than the former. 'All my efforts are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">{419}</a></span>
vain,' he wrote to Zwingle; 'there are about <i>seven
hundred</i> clergymen in Geneva who do their utmost
to prevent the Gospel from flourishing here.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_725" id="Ref_725" href="#Foot_725">[725]</a></span>
What can I do against such numbers? And yet a wide
door is opened to the Word of God.... The priests
do not preach; and as they are unable to do so, they
are satisfied with saying mass in Latin.... Miserable
nourishment for the poor people!... If any preachers
were to come here, proclaiming Christ with boldness,
the doctrine of the pope would, I am sure, be soon
overthrown.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_726" id="Ref_726" href="#Foot_726">[726]</a></span></p>

<p>But such preachers did not appear. Convinced of
his insufficiency, and continually repeating that true
ministers, like Zwingle and Farel, were wanted in that
city; finding that many of the Genevans desired to
be liberated not only from the vexations of Savoy, the
shuffling of the bishop, and the doctrines of the pope,
but also from the laws of morality; struck with the
evils he saw ready to burst upon Geneva, and which
the Gospel alone could avert,—this simple-minded,
pious, and sensitive man returned heartbroken to
Berne. Had this disappointment any effect upon
his health? We cannot say; but he died not long
after, in the month of November, 'as a christian ought
to die,' it was said. It was found after his departure
that his exertions had not been useless, and that some
Genevans at least had profited by his teaching: among
their number were counted Besançon Hugues and
Baudichon de la Maison-Neuve. Some astonishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">{420}</a></span>
may be felt at seeing these two names together, for
they are those of the chiefs of two opposite parties;
but there is nothing improbable about it, for Hugues
must have been frequently brought into contact with
Ab Hofen, and it is not impossible that he listened to
his religious conversation. Hugues was a serious man;
he was, moreover, a statesman, and must have desired
to know something about the religious opinions which
seemed at that time likely to be adopted by the whole
confederation; but his policy consisted in maintaining
the rights of the bishop-prince on one side, and those
of the citizens on the other; as for his religion, he was
a catholic, and we do not see that he changed in either
of those relations. What he might have been, if he
had been living at the time when the Reformation
was carried through, no one can say. De la Maison-Neuve,
on the contrary, was a decided huguenot, and
certainly needed the Gospel to moderate the ardour of
his character. William de la Mouille, the bishop's
chamberlain and confidant, appears to have been the
person who profited most by the teaching of the layman
of Berne.</p>

<p class="side">=SACK OF ROME.=</p>

<p>While the Gospel was entering Geneva, desolation
was entering Rome. It is a singular circumstance,
the meeting of these two cities in history: one so
powerful and glorious, the other so small and obscure.
That, however, is capable of explanation: the great
things of the world have always come from great
cities and great nations; but the great things of God
have usually small beginnings. Conquerors must have
treasures and armies; but evangelical christianity,
which undertakes to change man, nations, and the
whole human race, has need of the strength of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">{421}</a></span>
God, and God affects little things. In the first century,
he chose Jerusalem; in the middle ages, the
Waldensian valleys; in the sixteenth century, Wittemberg
and Geneva. 'God hath chosen the weak
things of the world to confound the things which
are mighty.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_727" id="Ref_727" href="#Foot_727">[727]</a></span></p>

<p>In the month of May (1527) a rumour of startling
importance suddenly spread through the world:
'Rome has just been destroyed,' said the people, 'and
there is no more pope.' The troops of Charles V.
had taken and sacked the pontifical city, and if the
pope was still alive, he was in concealment and almost
in prison. The servants of the Church, who were
terrified at first, soon recovered their breath, and
directly their alarm was dissipated, avarice and covetousness
took its place. In the presence of the
ruins of that ancient city, its friends thought only
of dividing its spoils. The Bishop of Geneva, in
particular, found himself surrounded by petitioners,
who sought to be collated to the benefices hitherto
held by clergymen resident in Rome. 'They have
all perished,' he was told; 'their benefices are vacant:
give them to us.' The bishop granted everything;
and he even conferred on himself (Bonivard tells us)
the priory of St. Jean-lez-Genève, which belonged to a
cardinal. Seldom had so many deaths made so many
people happy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_728" id="Ref_728" href="#Foot_728">[728]</a></span></p>

<p>The sack of Rome had more important results
for Geneva and the protestant nations. When they
saw the ruin of that city, it appeared to them that the
papacy had fallen with it. The huguenots never grew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">{422}</a></span>
tired of listening to the wonderful news and of commenting
upon it. Struck with the example set them by
Charles V., they thought to themselves that 'if the emperor
had set aside the bishop and prince of Rome, they
might well abandon the prince and bishop of Geneva.'
Their right to do so was far clearer. The pope-king
had at least been elected at Rome, and in conformity
with ancient custom; while the bishop-prince had not
been elected at Geneva and by Genevans, in accordance
with the ancient constitutions, but by a foreign
and unlawful jurisdiction. The huguenots promised
even to be more moderate than his catholic majesty.
Finally, the acts which impelled them to turn Pierre
de la Baume out of the city, were far more vexatious
in their eyes than those which had induced Charles to
expel Clement VII. from Rome. 'Are we not much
more oppressed by ecclesiastical tyranny,' they said,
'than by secular tyranny? Are we not forced to
pay, always to pay, and is it not our money that
makes the bishop's pot boil?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_729" id="Ref_729" href="#Foot_729">[729]</a></span>
Further, the shameful
conduct of many of the ecclesiastics seemed to
them a sufficient motive for putting an end to their
rule.</p>

<p>A scandal which occurred just at this time increased
the desire felt by certain huguenots to withdraw themselves
from the government of the monks and priests.
On the 10th of May, certain inhabitants of St. Leger
appeared before the council. For some time past
their sleep had been disturbed by noises and shouting,
in which the cordeliers, jacobins, and other friars were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">{423}</a></span>
concerned; and they desired to put an end to it.
'Some disorderly women have settled in our quarter,'
they told the council, 'and certain monks frequent
their houses.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_730" id="Ref_730" href="#Foot_730">[730]</a></span>
... 'If you observe the monks going
there at night-time,' replied the council, 'give information
to the syndics and the captain-general. The watch
will immediately go and take them.' The citizens
withdrew half satisfied with the answer, but fully
determined to call the watch as soon as the disorder
was renewed.</p>

<p class="side">=UNION OF FAITH AND MORALITY.=</p>

<p>These scandals—an acknowledged thing at Rome—greatly
exasperated the citizens of Geneva, and made
the better disposed long for a reformation of faith
and morals. They said that soldiers use their arms
as their officers command them: that the monks and
priests (they should have said all christians) ought
also to use their lives as their chief orders them;
and that if they make a contrary use of them, they
enlist under the standard of vice and avow themselves
its soldiers. The worthy citizens of Geneva could
not make that separation between religion and morality,
of which the greater part of the clergy set
the example. In proportion as the Reformation made
progress in the world, the opposition increased against
a piety which consisted only in certain formulas, ceremonies,
and practices, but was deprived of its true
substance—living faith, sanctification, morality, and
christian works. Christianity, by the separation which
Rome had made between doctrines and morals, had
become like one of those spoilt and useless tools that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">{424}</a></span>
are thrown aside because they can no longer serve
in the operations for which they were made. The
reformers, by calling for a living, holy, active faith,
were again to make christianity in modern times a
powerful engine of light and morality, of liberty and
life.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">THE BISHOP CLINGS TO GENEVA, BUT THE CANONS DEPART.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Summer 1527.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="side">=THE BISHOP'S NEW SCHEMES.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE sack of Rome had made a great sensation in
catholic countries. Pierre de la Baume almost
believed that the reign of popery had come to an end,
and was much alarmed for himself. If a prince so
powerful as the pope had succumbed, what would
become of the Bishop of Geneva? The alliance with
the cantons, and the Gospel which a Swiss magistrate
had just been preaching, seemed to him the forerunners
of his ruin. He had no lansquenets before him,
like those who had compelled Clement VII. to flee,
but he had huguenots, who, in his eyes, were more
formidable still. Liberty seemed to be coming forth,
like the sun, from the night of the middle ages; and
the bishop thought the safest course would be to turn
towards the rising orb, and to throw himself into the
arms of the liberals. He had a strong preference for
the Savoyard despotism; but, if his interests required
it, he was ready to pay court to liberty. Other instances
of this have been seen. The bishop, therefore,
sanctioned the sequestration of the property of
the mamelukes, and made Besançon Hugues a magnificent
present. He conferred on him the perpetual
fief of the fishery of the lake, the Rhone, and the Arve,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">{426}</a></span>
reserving to himself (which showed the value of the
gift) the right of redemption for two thousand great
ducats of gold.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_731" id="Ref_731" href="#Foot_731">[731]</a></span>
All this was but a step towards the
accomplishment of a strange design.</p>

<p>The bishop had taken it into his head that he would
form an alliance with the Swiss, feeling convinced that
they alone could protect him against the impetuosity
of the huguenots and the tyranny of the Duke of
Savoy. He therefore sent Robert Vandel to Friburg
and Basle, to entreat these states to admit him into
their citizenship. This move caused the greatest surprise
among the Genevans. 'What!' said they, 'is
Monseigneur turning huguenot?' The Swiss rudely
rejected the Romish prelate's request. 'We will not
have the bishop for our fellow-citizen,' they made
answer, 'and that for four reasons: first, he is fickle
and changeable; second, he is not beloved in Geneva;
third, he is imperialist and Burgundian; and fourth,
he is a <i>priest</i>!' The cantons did not mention the
strongest reason. Friburg and Berne, allies of the
city, could not be at the same time the allies of the
bishop, for how could they have supported the rights
of the Genevans against him?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_732" id="Ref_732" href="#Foot_732">[732]</a></span></p>

<p>The bishop was not discouraged. At one time he
felt his throne shaking beneath him, and, fearing that
it would fall, he clung to liberty with all his might;
at another, he fancied he could see the phantom of
heresy approaching with slow but sure step, and
erelong taking its seat on his throne ... and the
sight increased his fear. He therefore sent Besançon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">{427}</a></span>
Hugues to Berne—a more influential diplomatist than
Vandel—who was received with consideration in the
aristocratic circles, but had to bear all kinds of reproach.
The proud Bernese were indignant at his
becoming the advocate of a person so little esteemed
as the bishop. One day, in the presence of these
energetic men who had witnessed so many struggles,
as Hugues was warmly pleading the prelate's cause,
his listener suddenly turned away with horror, and,
as if he had been waving aside with his hand some
satanic vision, he said: 'The name of the bishop is
more hateful among us than that of the devil himself.'
This was enough for Hugues, who returned to Geneva
greatly disheartened. Pierre de la Baume, a vain and
frivolous priest, soon consoled himself for this discomfiture,
laughing at the reproaches uttered against him.
He amused himself with the objections of the Swiss,
and was continually repeating to those about him:
'What would you have?... How could the Helvetians
receive me into their alliance? I am a priest
and Burgundian!'... Thus, at one time trembling,
at another laughing, the Bishop of Geneva was moving
towards his ruin.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_733" id="Ref_733" href="#Foot_733">[733]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE DUKE PLOTS AGAINST THE BISHOP.=</p>

<p>For some time Charles III., Duke of Savoy, had
been watching the prelate, and noting with vexation
the interested and (in his opinion) culpable overtures
he was making to the Genevans and the confederates.
The news that the bishop had sent two envoys in
succession to the Swiss put a climax to the prince's
anger. It is not sufficient for the citizens to desire to
emancipate themselves; even the bishops, whom the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">{428}</a></span>
dukes have always regarded as their agents, presume
to tread in their footsteps. This deserves a terrible
punishment. The duke conferred with his advisers
on the nature of the lesson to be given the prelate.
One of the most decided of Charles's ministers proposed
that he should be kidnapped; the motion was
supported, and the resolution taken. In order to
carry it into execution, it was necessary to gain some
of the clergy about him. The canons were sounded,
and many of them, already sold to the duke, promised
their good offices. 'The bishop is a great devotee of
the Virgin,' they said; 'on Saturday, the day dedicated
to St. Mary, he generally goes to hear mass
at Our Lady of Grace, outside the city. He rides on
a mule in company with other members of the cloth.
Now, as this church is separated from Savoy only
by a bridge, the captain of his highness's archers has
simply to lie in ambush near the river to snap up
(<i>happer</i>) Monseigneur. The priests and officers about
him, being bribed or men of no courage, will run away.
Let him be dragged hastily to the other side of the
Arve, and, once in the territory of Savoy, he can be
put to death as a traitor.' Everything was arranged
by good catholics, and the Archbishop of Turin probably
had a share in it. The reformers never went
to work in so off-hand a manner as regards bishops.</p>

<p class="side">=THE DUKE'S AMBUSCADE.=</p>

<p>Thus war broke out between the two great enemies
of Geneva. The Genevans knew not how to get rid
of the prelate, and here was Charles, like another
Alexander, cutting the Gordian knot. The bishop
once carried off, one of the most formidable obstacles
to independence, morality, religion, and civilisation
will be removed. So long as he is there, nothing that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">{429}</a></span>
is good can be done in Geneva; and when he is no
longer there, the city will become free. This, however,
was not his highness's plan: having 'snapped
up' the duke, he expected to 'snap up' the city
also. This was his scheme for taking Geneva. 'As
soon as the Savoyard archers have kidnapped the
bishop, certain of his highness's creatures will go to
the belfry of Notre Dame and ring the great bell.
All the bells of the adjoining villages will answer the
signal; the nobles will rush sword in hand from their
castles, the country-people will take up their scythes
or other weapons, and all will march to Geneva.
The Genevans are hot and hasty: when they learn
that the Savoyards have crossed the Arve and violated
their territory, they will take up arms and march into
the domains of Savoy to avenge the offence; but they
will find Pontverre and all his friends there ready to
meet them. In the midst of this agitation the duke
will have a capital excuse for entering the city and
taking possession of it. And when he is established
there, he will cut off the heads of Hugues, the
syndics, the councillors, M. de Bonmont, and many
others. Finally, Geneva shall have a bishop who will
occupy himself with refuting the heretics, and his
highness will undertake to make the hot-headed
republicans bow beneath the sword of the temporal
power, and expel for ever from the city both reformers
and Reformation.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_734" id="Ref_734" href="#Foot_734">[734]</a></span>
The duke, charmed with this
plan, made immediate preparations for its execution.
To prevent Pierre de la Baume from escaping into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">{430}</a></span>
Burgundy, he posted soldiers in all the passes of the
Jura, whilst his best captains were stationed round
the city to carry out the ambuscade.</p>

<p class="side">=THE DUKE'S PLOT FAILS.=</p>

<p>These various measures could not be taken without
something creeping out. Geneva had friends in the
villages, where an unusual agitation indicated the
approaching execution of some act of treachery. On
Thursday, the 11th of July, a man, making his way
along by-paths, arrived from Savoy, and said to the
people of Geneva: 'Be on your guard!' Two days
later, Saturday the 13th, which was the day appointed
for action, another man, crossing the bridge of Arve,
came and told one of the syndics, between eight and
nine in the morning, that some horse and foot soldiers
had been secretly posted at Lancy, only half a league
from the city. The syndics did not trouble themselves
much about it; and the bishop, who was naturally
a timid man, but whom these warnings had not
reached, mounted his mule—it was the day when he
went to make adoration to the Virgin—rode out to
Our Lady's, took his usual place, and the mass began.
Charles's soldiers were already advancing in the direction
of the bridge, in order to seize the prelate directly
he left the church. Some devout persons had pity on
him, and just as the priest had celebrated the mystery,
a man, with troubled look, entered the building
(whether he came from Geneva or Savoy is unknown),
walked noiselessly to the place where the bishop was
sitting, and whispered in his ear: 'Monseigneur, the
archers of Savoy are preparing to clutch you (<i>gripper</i>).'
At these words the startled La Baume turned pale
and trembled. He did not wait for the benediction;
fear gave him wings; he got up, rushed hastily out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">{431}</a></span>
of the church, and leaped upon his mule 'without
putting his foot in the stirrup, for he was a very
nimble person,' says Bonivard; then, using his heels
for spurs, he struck the animal's flanks, and galloped
off full speed, shouting, at the top of his
voice, to the guards as he passed: 'Shut the gates!'
The prelate reached the city out of breath and all of
a tremble.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_735" id="Ref_735" href="#Foot_735">[735]</a></span></p>

<p>The city was soon in commotion. Besançon Hugues,
the captain-general, who was sincerely attached to La
Baume, and strongly opposed to the usurpations of
Savoy, had divined the duke's plot, and, with his usual
energy, began to pass through the streets, saying:
'Close your shops, put up the chains, bolt the city
gates, beat the drum, sound an alarm, and let every
man take his arquebuse.' Then, leaving the streets,
Hugues went to St. Pierre's, and, notwithstanding the
opposition of the canons, accomplices in the conspiracy,
he ordered the great bell to be rung. A rumour had
already spread on the other side of the Arve that the
plot had failed, and that the bishop had escaped on his
mule. The men-at-arms of Savoy were disconcerted;
the village bells were not rung, the nobles remained
in their castles, the peasants in their fields. 'Our
scheme has got wind,' said the Savoyard captains; 'all
the city is under arms; and we must wait for a better
opportunity.'</p>

<p>The canons, though siding with the duke, had concealed
their game, and employed certain creatures of
Savoy to carry out the plot. These people were known;
they became alarmed, and saw no other means of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">{432}</a></span>
escaping death than by leaving the city. But all the
gates were shut!... What of that: despair gave them
courage. At the very moment when the armed men
of Savoy were retiring, several persons were seen to
run along the streets, jump into the ditches of St. Gervais,
scale the palisades, and scamper away as fast as
their legs could carry them. They were the traitors
who had corresponded with the enemy outside.</p>

<p>As for La Baume, he had lost his presence of mind.
Rejected by the Swiss, despised by the Genevans,
persecuted by the duke, what should he do? If he
could but escape to his benefices in Burgundy, where
the people are so quiet and the wine is so good!—but,
alas! all the passes of the Jura are occupied by
Savoyard soldiers. He was in great distress. Not
thinking himself safe in his palace, he had taken
refuge in the house of one of his partisans when he
returned on his mule from his visit to Our Lady's.
He expected that the duke would follow up his plan,
would enter Geneva, and seek him throughout the
city. Accordingly, he remained quiet in the most
secret hiding-place of the house which had sheltered
him. It was only when he was told that the Savoyard
soldiers had really retired, that all was tranquil outside
the city, and that even the huguenots did not
think of laying hands on him, that he took courage,
came out of his hiding-place, and returned to the
palace. Nevertheless, he looked stealthily out of the
window to see if the huguenots or the ducal soldiers
were not coming to seize him even in his own house.
The Genevans smiled at his terror; but everybody,
the creatures of Charles excepted, was pleased at the
failure of the duke's treachery. Religious men saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">{433}</a></span>
the hand of Heaven in this deliverance. 'They gave
God thanks,' says Balard.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_736" id="Ref_736" href="#Foot_736">[736]</a></span></p>

<p>This attack, abortive as it was, had one important
consequence; it delivered the city from the canons,
and thus paved the way for the Reformation. These
men were in Geneva the representatives and supporters
of all kinds of religious and political tyranny.
To save catholicism, it would have been necessary for
the clergy, and particularly for the canons, who were
their leaders, to unite with the laity, and, while maintaining
the Roman ceremonial, to demand the suppression
of certain episcopal privileges and ecclesiastical
abuses. Some of the huguenot chiefs—those who,
like Hugues, loved the bishop, and those also who
subsequently opposed Calvin's reformation—would
probably have entered with joy into this order of
things. For the execution of such a plan, however, the
priests ought to have been upright and free. But the
absolute authority of the Church, which had enfeebled
the vigour of the human mind, had specially degraded
the priests. The clergy of Geneva had fallen too low
to effect a transformation of catholicism. Many of
the canons and even of the curés could see nothing
but the act of a revolutionist or even of a madman in
the bishop's desire to ally himself with the Swiss, and
had consequently entered into Charles's scheme, which
was so hateful to the Genevans.</p>

<p class="side">=THE BISHOP IMPRISONS THE CANONS.=</p>

<p>The huguenots hastened to take advantage of it. If
the ducal plot had not delivered them from the bishop,
it must at least free them from the canons. These
ecclesiastical dignitaries never quitted Geneva, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">{434}</a></span>
the bishop often absented himself to intrigue in Italy
or to amuse himself in Burgundy. They were besides
more bigoted and fanatical than the worldly prelate,
and therefore all the more dangerous. And then, if
they desired to get rid of the bishop, was it not the
wisest plan to begin with his council? Shortly after
the famous alert, some Genevan liberal went to the
palace and said to La Baume: 'The canons, my lord,
are the duke's spies: so long as they remain in Geneva,
Savoy will have one foot in the city.' The poor bishop
was too exasperated against the canons not to lend an
ear to these words, and after ruining himself with the
duke, he took steps to ruin himself with the clergy,
and to throw overboard the most devoted friends of
the Roman institutions. 'Yes,' said he, 'they intrigue
(<i>grabugent</i>) against the Church!... Let them be arrested....
It is they who wished to see me kidnapped....
Let them be put in prison!' The next morning
the procurator-fiscal, with his sergeants, knocked at the
doors of the most influential of the canons, Messieurs
De la Madeleine, De Montrotier, De Salery, De Veigy,
and others, arrested them, and, to the indescribable
astonishment of the servants and neighbours of these
reverend gentlemen, carried them off to prison.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_737" id="Ref_737" href="#Foot_737">[737]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the gates were shut upon the canons,
the bishop began to reflect on the daring act he had
just achieved. Still flushed with anger, he did not
repent, but he was uneasy, distressed, and amazed
at his own courage. If the duke sought to kidnap
him but the other day, what will this terrible prince
do, now that he, La Baume, has boldly thrown his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">{435}</a></span>
most devoted partisans into prison?... All Savoy
will march against him. He sent for the captain-general,
imparted to him all his fears; and Besançon
Hugues, his most faithful friend, wishing to dissipate
his alarm, placed watchmen on the tower of St. Pierre,
on the walls, and at every gate. They had instructions
to inform the commander-in-chief if a single
horseman appeared on the horizon in the direction of
Savoy.</p>

<p class="side">=HE DESIRES TO BE MADE FREE OF THE CITY.=</p>

<p>La Baume began to breathe again; yet he was not
entirely at his ease. He smiled to himself at the
<i>watch</i> of Besançon Hugues. What can these few
armed citizens do against the soldiers of the nephew
of Francis I. and brother-in-law of Charles V.? The
Duke of Savoy was prowling round him like a wild
beast eager to devour him; the bishop thought that
the bear of Berne alone could defend him. But alas!
Berne would have nothing to do with him, because he
was a <i>priest</i> and a <i>Burgundian</i>!... He turned all
this over in his mind. He, so wary a politician, he
whom the emperor employed in his negotiations—shall
not he find some outlet, when it is a question of
saving himself? On a sudden he hit upon a scheme
for becoming an ally of Berne, in spite of Berne.
He will get himself made a <i>citizen of Geneva</i>, and, by
virtue of the general co-citizenship, he will thus become
the ally of the cantons. Delighted at this bright
idea, he communicated it to his intimate friends,
and, unwilling to lose a day, ordered the council-general
to be convened for the morrow.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_738" id="Ref_738" href="#Foot_738">[738]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">{436}</a></div>

<p>On the next morning (15th of July) the bells of
the cathedral rang out; the burgesses, girding on
their swords, left their houses to attend the general
council, and the bishop-prince, accompanied by his
councillors and officers, appeared in the midst of the
people, and sat down on the highest seat. Entirely
absorbed by the strange ambition of becoming a plain
burgess of the city in which he was prince, he was
profuse in salutations; and to the huguenots he was
particularly gracious. 'I recall,' he said, 'my protest
against the alliance with the Swiss. I know how you
cling to it; well! ... I now approve of it; I am
willing to give my adhesion to it; and, the more
clearly to show my approval, I desire that I may be
made a freeman of the city.' Great was the astonishment
of the people. A bishop made a citizen of
Geneva! Such a thing had never been heard of. All
the friends of independence, however, were favourable
to the scheme. Some wished to gratify the bishop;
others were pleased at anything that could separate
him more completely from the duke; all agreed that
if the bishop were made a citizen of Geneva, and united
with their friends the confederates, great advantage
would result to the city. If he begins with turning
Swiss, who knows if he will not turn protestant? The
general council therefore granted his request.</p>

<p class="side">=HE CONCEDES THE CIVIL JURISDICTION.=</p>

<p>Wishing to make him pay for his freedom, and
not to lose an opportunity of recovering their liberties,
the syndics begged him to transfer all civil
suits to lay jurisdiction. Laymen judges in an ecclesiastical
principality!... It was a great revolution,
and three centuries and more were to pass away
before a similar victory was gained in other states of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">{437}</a></span>
that class. The bishop understood the great importance
of such a request; he fancied he could already
hear the endless appeals of the clergy who found
themselves deprived of their honours and their profits;
but at this time he was acting the part of a liberal
pope, while the canons were playing the incorrigible
cardinals. He said Yes. It was an immense gain
to the community, for interminable delays and crying
abuses characterised the ecclesiastical tribunals at
Geneva as well as at Rome.</p>

<p>The syndics, transported with joy, manifested all
their gratitude to the prelate. They told him he had
nothing to fear, either from the Genevans or even
from the duke. Then turning to the people, they
said: 'Let every citizen draw his sword to defend
Monseigneur. If he should be attacked, we desire
that, at the sound of the tocsin, all the burgesses, and
even the priests, should fly to arms.'—'Yes, yes!'
shouted the citizens; 'we will be always faithful to
him!' A transformation seemed to have been effected
in their hearts. They knew the great value of the
sacrifice the bishop had made, and showed their
thankfulness to him. Upon this, the bishop, 'raising
his right hand towards heaven, and placing his left
on his breast (as was the custom of prelates),' said:
'I promise, on my faith, loyally to perform all that
is required of a citizen, to prove myself a good
prince, and never to separate myself from you!'
The delighted people also raised their hands and
exclaimed: 'And we also, my lord, will preserve you
from harm as we would our own heads!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_739" id="Ref_739" href="#Foot_739">[739]</a></span>
The poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">{438}</a></span>
prelate would have sacrificed still more to protect
himself from Charles's attacks, which filled him with
indescribable terror.</p>

<p>It seemed as if this concession, by uniting the
bishop and the Genevans more closely, ought to have
put off the Reformation; but it was not so. In proportion
as the Genevans obtained any concession, they
desired more; accordingly, when the citizens had returned
home, or when they met at one another's houses,
they began to say that it was something to have
obtained the civil judicature from the bishop, but that
there were other restitutions still to be made. Some
men asked by what right he held the temporal authority;
and others—those who knew best what was
passing at Zurich—desired to throw off the spiritual
jurisdiction of the prelate in order to acknowledge
only that of Holy Writ.</p>

<p>Opposition to ecclesiastical principalities began,
then, three centuries ago at Geneva. 'The bishop
grants us the civil jurisdiction,' said Bonivard; 'an
act very damaging to himself, and very profitable to
us.... But ... this is an opening to deprive him
entirely of his authority. Neither La Baume nor the
other bishops were lawfully elected, that is to say by
the clergy at the postulation of the people. They were
thrust into the see by the pope.... They are but
tyrants set over us by other tyrants. We can therefore
reject them without danger to our souls; and
since they came in by the caprice of arbitrary power,
it is lawful for us to expel them by the free authority
of the city. Geneva has never acknowledged other
princes than those whom the people themselves elected.'
Some were astonished at Bonivard's language; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">{439}</a></span>
larger number listened to him with enthusiasm. The
catholics, growing more and more uneasy, anticipated
great disasters. The edifice of popery, continually
undermined in Geneva, was tottering; its pillars and
buttresses were giving way; and the keystone of the
arch, the episcopal power itself, was on the point of
crumbling to dust. Alas! catholic Geneva was a dismantled
fortress.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_740" id="Ref_740" href="#Foot_740">[740]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE DUKE'S IRRITATION.=</p>

<p>When the duke heard of the bishop's concessions, he
was seized with one of his fits of anger. And not
without cause: by transferring the civil authority to
a lay tribunal, La Baume had been guilty of a new
offence against the duke; for it was in reality the
jurisdiction of the vidame (that is to say, of the duke)
which the bishop had thus ceded; and hence it was
that he had been induced to do it so readily.</p>

<p>Charles had no need of this new grievance. When
they learnt at the court of Turin that the canons had
been put in prison by the prelate, there was a violent
commotion; the friends and relatives of those reverend
gentlemen made a great noise, and the duke
resolved to send the most urgent remonstrances to
the Genevans, reserving the right to have recourse to
more energetic measures if words did not suffice. He
commissioned M. de Jacob, his grand equerry, to
go and set this little people to rights, and the ducal
envoy arrived in Geneva about the middle of July.
He carried his head very high, and behaved with
great reserve, as if he had been injured: he had come
with the intention of making that city, so small and
yet so arrogant, feel how great is the power of a mighty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">{440}</a></span>
prince. On the 20th of July, the Sire de Jacob being
introduced before the council, haughtily represented
to them, not that the reverend fathers imprisoned as
criminals were innocent, but that they belonged to high
families and were his highness's subjects, and added
that the duke consequently ordered them to be immediately
set at liberty. 'Otherwise,' added the ambassador
in an insolent tone, 'my lord will see to it, as
shall seem good to him.' The tone and look of the ducal
envoy explained his words, and every one felt that
Charles III. would come and claim the canons at the
head of his army. The embarrassed magistrates and
prelates answered the envoy by throwing the blame
upon one another. The former declared that they had
not interfered in the matter, which concerned Monseigneur
of Geneva only; and the bishop, in his turn, laid
all the blame on the people. 'I was obliged to do so,'
he said, 'to save the canons from being killed.' Nevertheless,
he showed himself merciful. The avoyer of
Friburg, who had been delegated for this purpose by
his council, added his entreaties to the ducal summons;
and, pressed at once by Switzerland and Savoy, the
bishop thought he could not resist. The arrest of the
canons was in reality, on his part, an act of passion as
much as of justice. 'I release them,' he said; 'I
pardon them. I leave vengeance to God.'</p>

<p>The canons quitted the place where they had been
confined, bursting with anger and indignation. Having
had time to reflect on what was passing in Geneva, on
the impetuous current that was hurrying the citizens
in a direction contrary to Rome, they had made up
their minds to quit a city where they had been so unceremoniously
thrown into the receptacle for criminals.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">{441}</a></span>
De Montrotier, De Veigy, and their colleagues had
hardly returned to their houses when they told everybody
who would listen to them that they would leave
Geneva and the Genevans to their miserable fate.
This strange resolution immediately spread through
the city, and excited the people greatly; it was important
news, and they could hardly believe it. The
canons of Geneva were a very exalted body in the
opinion of catholicity. In order to be received among
them, the candidate must show titles of nobility or
be a graduate in some famous university; and since
the beginning of the century their number included
members of the most illustrious families of Savoy—De
Gramont, De la Foret, De Montfalcon, De Menthon,
De la Motte, De Chatillon, De Croso, De Sablon, and
others as noble as they.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_741" id="Ref_741" href="#Foot_741">[741]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE CANONS LEAVE THE CITY.=</p>

<p>The canons kept their word. As soon as they had
made the necessary arrangements for their departure,
they mounted their mules or got into their carriages,
and set off. The Genevans, standing at the doors of
their houses and in groups in the streets, watched these
Roman dignitaries thus abandoning their homes, some
with downcast heads, others with angry looks, who
moved along sad and silent, and went out by the
Savoy gate with hearts full of resentment against a
city which they denounced as ungrateful and rebellious.
Out of thirty-two, only seven or eight remained.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_742" id="Ref_742" href="#Foot_742">[742]</a></span>
The citizens, assembling in various places, were agitated
with very different thoughts. The huguenots said to
themselves that these high and reverend clerks, true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">{442}</a></span>
cardinals, who supported the papacy much better
than the bishop, would no longer be there to prevent
the new generation from throwing off the shackles of
the middle ages; that this unexpected exodus marked
a great revolution; and that the old times were departing,
and the Reformation beginning. On the other
hand, the creatures of Rome felt a bitter pang, and
flames of vengeance were kindled in their hearts.
Lastly, those citizens who were both good Genevans
and good catholics, were seized with fear and melancholy.
'No more canons, erelong perhaps no more
bishop!... Will Geneva, without its canons and
bishops, be Geneva still?' But the great voice, which
drowned all the rest, was that of the partisans of progress,
of liberty, of independence, and of reform, who
desired to see political liberty developed among the
community, and the Church directed by the Word of
God and not by the bulls of the pope. Among them
were Maison-Neuve, Bonivard, Porral, Bernard, Chautemps,
and others. These men, the pioneers of modern
times, felt little respect and no regret for the canons.
They said to one another that these noble and lazy
lords were pleased with Geneva so long as they could
luxuriously enjoy the pleasures of life there; but that
when the hour of combat came, they fled like cowards
from the field of battle. The canons did fly in fact;
they arrived at Annecy, where they settled. As for
Geneva, they were never to enter it again.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">THE BISHOP-PRINCE FLEES FROM GENEVA.<br />
 (<span class="smc">July and August 1527.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="side">=BISHOPERS AND COMMONERS.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">FROM this time parties in Geneva took new forms
and new names. There were not simply, as before,
partisans of the foreign domination and Savoy,
and those of independence and Switzerland: the latter
were divided. Some, having Hugues and Balard as
leaders, declared for the bishop; others, with Maison-Neuve
and Porral at their head, declared for the
people. They desired not only to repel the usurpations
of Savoy, but also to see the fall of the temporal
power of the bishop in Geneva. 'Now,' said Bonivard,
'that the first division into mamelukes and
huguenots has almost come to an end, we have the
second—that of bishopers (<i>évêquains</i>) and commoners
(<i>communiaires</i>).' These two parties had their
men of sense and importance, and also their hotheaded
adherents; as, for instance, De la Thoy on
the side of the commoners, and Pécolat, the man of
whom it would have been least expected, among the
bishopers. A singular change had been effected in
this former martyr of the bishop: the <i>jester</i> had joined
the episcopal band. Was it because he was at heart
catholic and even superstitious (he had ascribed, it
will be remembered, the healing of his tongue to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">{444}</a></span>
intervention of a saint), or because, being a thorough
parasite, he preferred the well-covered tables of the
bishopers? We know not. These noisy partisans,
the vanguard of the two parties, were frequently
quarrelling. 'They murmured, jeered, and made
faces at each other.'</p>

<p>At the same time this new division marked a step
made in advance by this small people. Two great
questions were raised, which sooner or later must
rise up in every country. The first was <i>political</i>, and
may be stated thus: 'Must we accept a traditional
dominion which has been established by trampling
legitimate rights under foot?' (This was the dominion
of the bishop.) The second was <i>religious</i>, and
may be expressed thus: 'Which must we choose,
popery or the Gospel?' Many of the <i>commoners</i>, seeing
the bishop and the duke disputing about Geneva,
said that these two people were fighting for what belonged
to neither of them, and that Geneva belonged
to the Genevans. But there were politicians also
among them, lawyers for the most part, who founded
their pretensions on a legal basis. The bishops and
princes of Geneva ought by right, as we have seen, to
be elected at Geneva and not at Rome, by Genevans
and not by Romans. The issue of the struggle was
not doubtful. How could the bishop make head
against magistrates and citizens relying on positive
rights, and against the most powerful aspirations of
liberty that were awaking in men's hearts? How
could the Roman doctrine escape the floods of the
Reformation? Certain scandals helped to precipitate
the catastrophe.</p>

<p>On the 12th of July some huguenots appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">{445}</a></span>
before the council. 'The priests of the Magdalen,'
they said, 'keep an improper house, in which reside
several disorderly women.' There were among the Genevans,
and particularly among the magistrates, men of
good sense, who had the fear of God before their eyes
and confidence in him in their hearts. These respectable
laymen (and there may have been priests who
thought the same) had a deep conviction that one of the
great defects of the middle ages was the existence of
popes, bishops, priests, and monks, who had separated
religion from morality. The council attended to these
complaints to a certain extent. They banished from
Geneva the persons who made it their business to
facilitate illicit intercourse, obliged the lewd women
to live in a place assigned them, and severely remonstrated
with the priests.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_743" id="Ref_743" href="#Foot_743">[743]</a></span>
The first breath of the
Reformation in Geneva attacked immorality. It was
not this affair, however, which gave the bishop his
death-blow; it was a scandal occasioned by himself,
and in his own house. 'Halting justice' was about
to overtake the guilty man at last.</p>

<p class="side">=ABDUCTION OF A YOUNG WOMAN.=</p>

<p>One day a report suddenly got abroad which put
the whole city in commotion. 'A young girl, of respectable
family,' said the crowd, 'has just been carried
off by the bishop's people: we saw them dragging her
to the palace.' It was an electric spark that set the
whole populace on fire. The palace gates had been
immediately closed upon the victim, and the bishop's
servants threatened to repel with main force the persons
who demanded her. 'Does the bishop imagine,'
said some of the patriots, 'that we will put up with
his beatings as quietly as the folks of St. Claude do?'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">{446}</a></span>
It would seem that La Baume permitted such practices
among the Burgundians, who did not complain
of them. The girl's mother, rushing into the street,
had followed her as fast as possible, and had only
stopped at the closed gates of the episcopal palace.
She paced round and round the building, roaring like
a lioness deprived of her whelp. The citizens, crowding
in front of the palace, exclaimed: 'Ha! you are
now throwing off the mask of holiness which you
held up to deceive the simple. In your churches you
kiss God's feet, and in your life you daringly spit in
his face!' Many of them called for the bishop, summoning
him to restore the young woman to her
mother, and hammering violently at the gate.</p>

<p>The prelate, who was then at dinner, did not like
to be disturbed in this important business; being
puzzled, moreover, as to the course which he ought to
adopt, it appeared that the best thing he could do was
to be deaf. He therefore answered his servants, who
asked him for orders, 'Do not open the door;' and
raising the glass to his lips, he went on with his repast.
But his heart was beginning to tremble: the
shouts grew louder, and every blow struck against
the gate found an echo in the soul of the guilty priest.
His servants, who were looking stealthily out of the
windows, having informed him that the magistrates
had arrived, Pierre de la Baume left his chair, paler
than death, and went to the window. There was a
profound silence immediately, and the syndics made
the prelate an earnest but very respectful speech.
The bishop, terrified at the popular fury, replied:
'Certainly, gentlemen, you shall have the young
woman.... I only had her carried off for a harper,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">{447}</a></span>
who asked me for her in return for his services.'
Monseigneur had not carried off the girl in the
violence of passion, but only to pay the wages of a
musician! It was not more guilty, but it was more
vile. The palace gates were opened, and the girl
was restored to her mother. Michael Roset does not
mention the harper, and leads us to believe that the
bishop had taken her for himself. This scandalous
abduction was the last act done in Geneva by the
Roman bishops.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_744" id="Ref_744" href="#Foot_744">[744]</a></span></p>

<p>From that moment the deposition of the bishop
was signed, as it were, in the hearts of most of the
citizens. 'These, then, are the priests' works,' they
said, 'debauchery and violence!... Instead of purifying
the manners of the people, they labour to corrupt
them! Ha! ha! you bishopers, a fine religion is that
of your bishop!'</p>

<p>Opposition to a corrupt government soon began to
appear a duty to them. The right of resistance was
one of the principles of that society in the middle
ages, which some writers uphold as a model of servility.
In the Great Charter of England, the king
authorised his own subjects, in case he should violate
any one of their liberties, 'to pursue and molest him
to the uttermost of their power, by seizing his castles,
estates, possessions, and otherwise.' In certain cases,
the vassals could separate themselves entirely from
their suzerain. Some vassals, it is true, might carry
this principle too far, and claim to throw off the
feudal authority <i>whenever it pleased them</i>; but the
law made answer: 'No, not unless there is <i>reasonable cause</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_745" id="Ref_745" href="#Foot_745">[745]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">{448}</a></span>
When freeing herself from the bishop-princes,
who had so often violated the franchises and
connived with the enemies of the city, Geneva thought
she was acting with very reasonable cause, and not
going beyond the bounds of legality. The ruin of the
bishops and princes of Geneva, already prepared by
their political misdeeds, was completed by their moral
disorders.</p>

<p>But if the friends of law and morality desired to
break by legal means the bonds which united them to
the bishop-prince, other persons, the wits and brawlers,
envenomed against his partisans, began to get up
quarrels with the bishopers. One day 'the young
men of Geneva,' returning from a shooting match,
where, says the chronicler, they had 'had many a
shot at the pot' (that is, had drunk deeply), determined
to give a smart lesson to two of the bishop's
friends, Pécolat and Robert Vandel. The latter, at
that time attached personally to Pierre de la Baume,
afterwards became one of the most zealous patriots.
'They are at St. Victor's,' somebody said; 'let us go
and fetch them.' The party, headed by a drummer,
went to the priory, where Bonivard told the ringleaders
that the two bishopers and others were
diverting themselves at Plainpalais. Just as the
band arrived, the episcopals were entering the city:
one of the 'sons of Geneva,' catching sight of Pécolat
and Vandel, exclaimed: 'My lord, you have traitors
among you there!' The bishop spurred his mule and
rode off; Pécolat drew his sword; his opponent, De la
Thoy, did the same, and they began to cut at each other.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">{449}</a></span>
The fray was so noisy that the guards in alarm shut
the gates, when a few reasonable men parted the combatants.
A more serious movement was accomplishing
in the depths of men's minds. Nothing but
secularisation and reformation could put an end to
the almost universal discontent.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_746" id="Ref_746" href="#Foot_746">[746]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE DUKE'S MENACES.=</p>

<p>The Duke of Savoy wished for another solution.
His councillors represented to him that the bishop
had lost his credit among the nobles and clergy,
through his desire to ally himself with the Swiss;
that he was ruined with the citizens by his unedifying
mode of life; and that the moment had come
for giving these restless people a <i>stronger shepherd</i>,
who would cure them of their taste for political and
religious liberty. In consequence of this, the duke
summoned the Genevans, on the 30th of July, to
recognise his claims, and his ambassadors added that,
if the citizens refused, 'Charles III. would come in
person with an army, and then they would have to
keep their city ... if they could.' The Genevans
made answer: 'We will suffer death rather.' The
Bernese, informed of the threats of Savoy, sent ambassadors
to Chambéry to admonish (<i>admonester</i>) the
duke. 'I have a grudge against the city,' he said,
'and against the bishop also, and I will do my pleasure
upon him in defiance of all opposition.'—'Keep
a good look-out,' said the Bernese ambassadors to
the syndics, on their return, 'for the duke is preparing
to carry off the bishop and confiscate the
liberties of the city.' The bishop and the citizens
were exceedingly agitated. Men, women, and children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">{450}</a></span>
set to work: they cut down the trees round the
walls, pulled down the houses, and levelled the gardens,
while four gangs worked at the fortifications.
'We would rather die defending our rights,' said the
Genevans, 'than live in continual fear.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_747" id="Ref_747" href="#Foot_747">[747]</a></span></p>

<p>It might have been imagined that the duke, by declaring
war at the same time against the bishop and the
city, would have brought them nearer each other; but
the popular irritation against the bishop and clergy
was only increased by it. The citizens said that all the
misfortunes of Geneva proceeded from their having a
bishop for a prince; and La Baume saw a conspirator
in every Genevan. More than one bishop, the oppressor
of the liberties of his people, had fallen during
the middle ages under the blows of the indignant
burgesses. For instance, the wretched Gaudri, bishop
of Laon in the twelfth century, having trampled the
rights of the citizens under foot, had been compelled
to flee from their wrath, and hide himself in a cask
in the episcopal cellar. But, being discovered and
dragged into the street, he was killed by the blow
of an axe, and his body covered with stones and mud.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_748" id="Ref_748" href="#Foot_748">[748]</a></span>
If good <i>catholics</i> had practised such revenge upon their
bishop, what would <i>huguenots</i> do?</p>

<p class="side">=THE BISHOP RESOLVES TO LEAVE GENEVA.=</p>

<p>La Baume had other fears besides. An intriguing
woman, his cousin Madame de Besse, generally known
as Madame de la Gruyère, being gained over by the
duke, alarmed the bishop by insinuating that he
was to be kidnapped, and that this time his mule
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">{451}</a></span>
would not save him. That lady had scarcely left the
palace when the Bernese entered and said to the
frightened bishop: 'Make haste to go! for the duke is
coming to take you.' They may have said this with
a mischievous intention, desiring to free the city from
the bishop. La Baume had not a minute of repose
afterwards. His servants, threatened by the huguenots,
began to be afraid also, and thus increased their master's
alarm. He passed the day in anguish, and awoke
in the night uttering cries of terror. At times he listened
as if he heard the footsteps of the men coming to
carry him off. He did not hesitate: his residence in the
episcopal city had become insupportable. He had too
much sense not to see that the cause of his temporal
principality was lost, and, to add to his misfortune, the
only prince who could defend him was turning against
him. Whatever the risk, he must depart. 'Whereat
the bishop was so vexed,' says Bonivard, 'that he
meditated retiring from Geneva into Burgundy.' He
flattered himself that he would be quiet in the midst
of his good vassals of St. Claude, and happy near his
cellars of Arbois!<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_749" id="Ref_749" href="#Foot_749">[749]</a></span></p>

<p>It was, however, no easy thing to do. He would
have to get out of Geneva, pass through the district of
Gex, and cross the Jura mountains, all filled with armed
men. Feeling the want of some one to help him, he
determined to apply to Besançon Hugues. He invited
him to come to the palace, but in the night, so that no
one might see him. When Hugues got there, the
wretched and guilty prelate squeezed his hand, and told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">{452}</a></span>
him all his troubles. 'I can no longer endure the
wrong, violence, and tyranny which the duke does me,'
he said. 'I know that he is plotting to kidnap me and
shut me up in one of his monasteries. On the other
hand, I mistrust my own subjects, for they are aiming
at my life. I am day and night in mortal torment.
You alone can get me out of the city, and I hope you
will manage so that it shall not be talked of.' Besançon
Hugues was touched when he saw the man whom he
recognised as his lord agitated and trembling before
him. How could he refuse the alarmed priest the
favour he so earnestly demanded?... He left the
bishop, telling him that he would go and make preparations
for a nocturnal flight.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_750" id="Ref_750" href="#Foot_750">[750]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=FLEES BY NIGHT TO ST. CLAUDE.=</p>

<p>In the night of the 1st and 2nd of August, 1527,
Hugues went secretly to the palace, accompanied by
Michael Guillet, a leading mameluke. The prelate
received his friends like liberating angels. They all
three went down into the vaults, where La Baume
ordered a private door to be opened which led into
the street now called the Rue de la Fontaine. He
had to go along this street to reach the lake; but
might not some of those terrible huguenots stop him
in his flight? He crept stealthily and in disguise out
of the palace, put himself between his two defenders,
and, a prey to singular alarm, went forward noiselessly.
On arriving at the brink of the water, the fugitive
and his two companions descried through the darkness
the boatmen whom Hugues had engaged. La
Baume and Besançon entered the boat, while Michael
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">{453}</a></span>
Guillet returned to the city. The boatmen took their
oars, and crossed the lake at the point where the
Rhone flows out of it. La Baume looked all round
him; but he could see nothing, could hear nothing
but the dull sound of the oars. The danger, however,
was far from being passed. The right bank might be
occupied by a band of his enemies.... When the boat
touched the shore, La Baume caught sight of two or
three men with horses. They were friends. Hugues
and the bishop got into their saddles without a
moment's loss, and galloped off in the direction of the
Jura. The bishop had never better appreciated his good
luck in being one of the best horsemen of his day; he
drove the spurs into his steed, fancying at times that
he heard the noise of Savoyard horses behind him. In
this way the bishop and his companion rode on, all the
night through, along by-roads and in the midst of great
dangers, for all the passes were guarded by men-at-arms.
At last the day appeared. In proportion as
they advanced, La Baume breathed more freely. After
four-and-twenty hours of cruel fright, the travellers
arrived at St. Claude. Pierre de la Baume was at the
summit of happiness.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_751" id="Ref_751" href="#Foot_751">[751]</a></span></p>

<p>The day after his departure, the news of the bishop's
flight suddenly became known in Geneva, where it
caused a great sensation. 'Alas!' said the monks in
their cloisters, 'Monseigneur, seeing the approaching
tribulation, has got away by stealth across the lake.'
The patriots, on the contrary, collecting in groups in
the public places, rejoiced to find themselves delivered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">{454}</a></span>
by one act both from their bishop and their prince.
At the same time the Savoyard soldiers, posted round
Geneva, were greatly annoyed; they had been on the
watch night and day, and yet the bishop had slipped
through their fingers. To avenge themselves, they
swore to arrest Besançon Hugues on his return. The
latter, making no stay at St. Claude, reappeared next
morning at daybreak in the district of Gex, when he
soon noticed that gentlemen and soldiers were all joining
in the chase after him. The bells were rung in the
village steeples, the peasants were roused, and every
one shouted: 'Hie! hie! the traitor Besançon!' It
seemed impossible for him to escape. Having descended
the mountain, he followed the by-roads through
the plain, when suddenly a number of armed men fell
upon him. Hugues had great courage, a stout sword,
and a good horse; fording the water-courses, and galloping
across the hills, he saved himself, 'as by a
miracle,' says his friend Balard.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_752" id="Ref_752" href="#Foot_752">[752]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE HIRELING FORSAKES THE SHEEP.=</p>

<p>The Genevans were very uneasy about him, for they
all loved him. The drums beat, the companies mustered
under their officers, and they were about to
march out with their arms to protect him, when suddenly
he arrived, panting, exhausted, and wounded.
They would have liked to speak to him, and, above
all, to hear him; but Hugues, hardly shaking hands
with his friends, rode straight to his own house and
went to bed; he was completely knocked up. The
syndics went to his room to investigate the circumstances
of which he had to complain. But erelong the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">{455}</a></span>
brave man recovered from his fatigue, and the city
was full of joy. The bishop's flight still further increased
their cheerfulness: it snapped the bonds of
which they were weary. 'The <i>hireling</i>,' they said,
'leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, when he seeth the wolf
coming.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_753" id="Ref_753" href="#Foot_753">[753]</a></span>
'Therefore,' they added, 'he is not the shepherd.'</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER V.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">EXCOMMUNICATION OF GENEVA AND FUNERAL PROCESSION OF
 POPERY.<br />
 (<span class="smc">August 1527 to February 1528.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Duke of Savoy was the wolf. When he heard
of the bishop's flight, his vexation was greater
than can be imagined. He had told the Bernese: 'I
shall have Monsieur of Geneva at my will,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_754" id="Ref_754" href="#Foot_754">[754]</a></span>
and now
the wily prelate had escaped him a second time. At
first Charles III. lost all self-control. 'I will go,' he
said, 'and drag him across the Alps with a rope round
his neck!' After which he wrote to him: 'I will
make you the poorest priest in Savoy;' and, proceeding
to gratify his rage, he seized upon the abbeys of
Suza and Pignerol, which belonged to La Baume.
Gradually his anger cooled down; the duke's counsellors,
knowing the bishop's irresolute and timid character,
said to their master: 'He is of such a changeable
disposition<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_755" id="Ref_755" href="#Foot_755">[755]</a></span>
that it will be easy to bring him
over again to the side of Savoy.' The prince yielded
to their advice, and sent Ducis, governor of the Château
de l'Ile, to try to win him back. It appeared to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">{457}</a></span>
ducal counsellors that Pierre de la Baume, having
fled from Geneva, could never return thither, and
would have no wish to do so; and that the time had
come when a negotiation, favourable in other respects
to the prelate, might put the duke in possession of a
city which he desired by every means to close against
heresy and liberty.</p>

<p class="side">=THE DUKE TRIES TO WIN THE BISHOP.=</p>

<p>The bishop, at that moment very dejected, was
touched by the duke's advances; he sent an agent to the
prince, and peace seemed on the point of being concluded.
But Charles had uttered a word that sounded
ill in the prelate's ears. 'The duke wishes me to
subscribe myself <i>his subject</i>,' he wrote to Hugues. 'I
think I know why.... It is that he may afterwards
lay hands on me.' Nevertheless, the duke appeared
to restrain himself. 'I will give back all your benefices,'
he told the bishop, 'if you contrive to annul
the alliance between Geneva and Switzerland.' La
Baume consented to everything in order to recover
his abbeys, whose confiscation made a large gap in his
revenues. He did not care much about living at
Geneva, but he wished to be at his ease in Burgundy.
At this moment, as the duke and the Genevans left
him at peace, he was luxuriously enjoying his repose.
Instead of being always in the presence of huguenots
and mamelukes, he walked calmly in his garden
'among his pinks and gilly-flowers.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_756" id="Ref_756" href="#Foot_756">[756]</a></span>
He ordered some
beautiful fur robes, lined with black satin, for the
winter; he kept a good table, and said: 'I am much
better supplied with good wine here than we are at
Geneva.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_757" id="Ref_757" href="#Foot_757">[757]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">{458}</a></div>

<p>The bishop having fled from his bishopric like a
hireling,—the prince having run away from his principality
like a conspirator,—the citizens resolved to take
measures for preserving order in the State, and to make
the constitution at once stronger and more independent.
The general council delegated to the three
councils of Twenty-five, Sixty, and Two-Hundred
the duty of carrying on the necessary business, except
in such important affairs as required the convocation
of the people. A secret council was also appointed,
composed of the four syndics and of six of the most
decided huguenots. A distinguished historian says
that the Genevan constitution was then made democratic;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_758" id="Ref_758" href="#Foot_758">[758]</a></span>
another historian affirms, on the contrary,
that the power of the people was weakened.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_759" id="Ref_759" href="#Foot_759">[759]</a></span>
We are of a different opinion from both. In proportion
as Geneva threw off foreign usurpation, it would
strengthen its internal constitution. Undoubtedly,
this little nation desired to be free, and the Reformation
was to preserve its liberties; there is a democracy
in the Reform. Philosophy, which is satisfied with a
small number of disciples, has never formed more than
an intellectual aristocracy; but evangelical christianity,
which appeals to all classes, and particularly to the
lowly, develops the understanding, awakens the conscience,
and sanctifies the hearts of those who receive
it, in this way spreading light, order, and peace all
around, and forming a true democracy on earth, very
different from that which does without Christ and
without God. But Geneva, at that time surrounded
by implacable enemies, required, as necessary to its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">{459}</a></span>
existence, not only liberty, but order, power, and consequently
authority.</p>

<p class="side">=THE DUCAL ARMS FALL AT GENEVA.=</p>

<p>The bishop had hardly disappeared from Geneva
when the insignia of ducal power disappeared also.
Eight years before this, Charles III. had caused the
white cross of Savoy, carved in marble, to be placed
on the Château de l'Ile, 'at which the friends of liberty
were much grieved.'—'I have placed my arms in the
middle of the city as a mark of sovereignty,' he had
said haughtily, 'and have had them carved in hard
stone. Let the people efface them if they dare!' On
the morning of the 6th of August (five days after the
bishop's flight), some people who were passing near
the castle perceived to their great astonishment that the
ducal arms had disappeared.... A crowd soon gathered
to the spot, and a lively discussion arose. Who did
it? was the general question. 'Oh!' replied some,
'the stone has accidentally fallen into the river;' but
although the water was clear, no one could see it.
'It was you,' said the duke's partisans to the huguenots,
'and you have hidden it somewhere.' Bonivard, who
stood thoughtful in the midst of the crowd, said at
last: 'I know the culprit.'—'Who is it? who is it?'
'St. Peter,' he replied. 'As patron of Geneva, he is
unwilling that a secular prince should have any ensign
of authority in his city!' This incident, the authors
of which were never known, made a great impression,
and the most serious persons exclaimed: 'Truly, it is a
visible sign, announcing to us a secret and mysterious
decision of the Most High. What the hand of God hath
thrown down, let not hand of man set up again!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_760" id="Ref_760" href="#Foot_760">[760]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">{460}</a></div>

<p>The Genevans wanted neither duke nor bishop;
they went farther still, and being harassed by the
court of Rome, they were going to show that they did
not care for the pope. They had hardly done talking
of La Baume's flight and of the Savoy escutcheon,
when they were told strange news. A report was
circulated that an excommunication and interdict
had been pronounced against them, at the request of
the mamelukes. This greatly excited such citizens
as were still attached to the Roman worship. 'What!'
said they; 'the priests will be suspended from their
functions, the people deprived of the benefit of the sacraments,
divine worship, and consecrated burial ...
innocent and guilty will be involved in one common
misery.'... But the energy of the huguenots, whom
long combats had hardened like steel, was not to be
weakened by this new attack. The most determined
of them resolved to turn against Rome the measure
plotted against Geneva. The council, being resolved to
prevent the excommunication from being placarded
in the streets,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_761" id="Ref_761" href="#Foot_761">[761]</a></span>
ordered 'a strict watch to be kept at
the bridge of Arve, about St. Victor and St. Leger,
and that the gates should be shut early and opened late.'
This was not enough. Five days later (the 29th of
December, 1527), the people, lawfully assembled,
caused the <i>Golden Bull</i> to be read aloud before them,
which ordered that, with the exception of the emperor
and the bishop, there should be no authority in
Geneva. Then a daring proposition was made to the
general council, namely, 'that no metropolitan letters,
and further still no apostolical letters (that is to say,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">{461}</a></span>
no decrees emanating from the pope's courts), should
be executed by any priest or any citizen.'—'Agreed,
agreed!' shouted everybody. It would seem that
the vote was almost unanimous. In this way the
bishop on the banks of the Tiber found men prepared
to resist him on the obscure banks of the Leman.</p>

<p>This vote alarmed a few timid persons of a traditional
tendency. Advocates of the <i>status quo</i> entreated the
progressionists to restrain themselves; but the latter
had no wish to do so. They answered that the Reformation
was triumphing among the Swiss; that
Zwingle, Œcolampadius, and Haller were preaching
with daily increasing success at Zurich, Basle, and
Berne. They added that on the 7th of January, 1528,
the famous discussion had begun in the last-named
city, and that the Holy Scriptures had gained the
victory; that the altars and images had been thrown
down 'with the consent of the people;' that a spiritual
worship had been substituted in their place, and that
all, including children fourteen years old, had sworn
to observe 'the Lutheran law.' The huguenots
thought that if excommunication came to them from
Rome, absolution would come to them from Berne—or
rather from heaven.</p>

<p class="side">=FUNERAL PROCESSION OF POPERY.=</p>

<p>The more light-hearted among them went further
than this. For ages the Roman Church had accustomed
its followers to unite masquerades with the most
sacred recollections. In some cantons there had been
great rejoicings over the abolition of the mass. Such
a fire could not be kindled in Switzerland without
scattering a few sparks over Geneva. Baudichon de
la Maison-Neuve, a great enemy to superstition, an
active and even turbulent man, and daring enough to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">{462}</a></span>
attempt anything, resolved to organise a funeral procession
of the papacy. He would attack Rome with
the weapons that the Roman carnival supplied him,
and would arrange a great procession. Whilst serious
men were reading the epistle from heaven (the Gospel),
which absolved them from the excommunication of its
pretended vicar, the young and thoughtless were in great
excitement; they dressed themselves in their houses
in the strangest manner; they disguised themselves,
some as priests, some as canons, and others as monks;
they came out, met together, drew up in line, and
soon began to march through the streets of the city.
There were white friars, grey friars, and black friars,
fat canons, and thin curates. One was begging,
another chanting; here was one scourging himself,
there another strutting solemnly along; here a man
carrying a hair shirt, there a man with a bottle.
Some indulged in acts of outrageous buffoonery;
others, the more completely to imitate the monks,
went so far as to take liberties with the women who
were looking on, and when some fat friar thus made
any burlesque gesture, there was loud applause, and
the crowd exclaimed: 'That is not the worst they
do.' In truth the reality was more culpable than
the burlesque. When they saw this tumultuous
procession and heard the doleful chanting, mingled
with noisy roars of laughter, every one said that
popery was dying, and singing its <i>De profundis</i>, its
burial anthem.</p>

<p>The priests took the jest in very bad part, and the
procession was hardly over before they hurried, flushed
with anger, to complain to the syndics of 'the enmity
raised against them by Baudichon and others.' The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">{463}</a></span>
syndics referred their complaint to the episcopal
council, and the latter severely reprimanded the
offenders. But Maison-Neuve and his friends withdrew,
fully convinced that the priests were in the
wrong, and that the victory would ultimately be on
their side.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_762" id="Ref_762" href="#Foot_762">[762]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=BONIVARD AT THE PRIORY.=</p>

<p>They were beginning in Geneva to estimate a
papal excommunication at its proper value. No one
knew more on this subject than Bonivard, and he
instructed his best friends on this difficult text.
Among the number was François Favre, a man of
ardent character, prompt wit, and rather worldly
manners, but a good citizen and determined huguenot.
Favre was one day, on a famous occasion, to be at the
head of Bonivard's liberators. He went sometimes
to the priory, where he often met Robert Vandel, a
man of less decision than his two friends. Vandel,
who still kept on good terms with the bishop, was
at heart one of the most independent of men, and
Bonivard had made him governor of the domain of
St. Victor.</p>

<p>These Genevans and others continued the conversations
that Bonivard had formerly had with Berthelier
in the same room and at the same table. They spoke
of Berne, of Geneva, of Switzerland, of the Reformation,
and of excommunication. Bonivard found erelong
a special opportunity of enlightening his two
friends on the acts of the Romish priesthood.</p>

<p class="side">=BONIVARD ON EXCOMMUNICATION.=</p>

<p>There was no one in Geneva whom the papal party
detested more than him. The ultramontanists could
understand why lawyers and citizens opposed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">{464}</a></span>
clergy; but a prior!... His enemies, therefore, formed
the project of seizing the estates of St. Victor, and of
expelling Bonivard from the monastery. The huguenots,
on hearing of this, ardently espoused his cause,
and the council gave him, for his protection (20th of
January, 1528) six arquebuses and four pounds of gunpowder.
These were hardly monastic weapons; but
the impetuous Favre hastened to offer him his heart
and his arm; and, to say the truth, Bonivard in case
of need could have made very good use of an arquebuse.
He had recourse, however, to other defenders;
he resolved to go and plead his cause before the League.
But this was not without danger, for the duke's agents
might seize him on the road, as he afterwards had the
misfortune to know. Favre, ever ready to go where
there was any risk to be run, offered to accompany
him to Berne. Vandel had to go as governor of St.
Victor: they set off. Arriving at a village in the Pays
de Vaud, the three huguenots dismounted and took a
stroll while their horses were resting. Bonivard, as
he was riding along, had noticed some large placards
on the doors of the churches, and being curious to
know what they were about, he went up to them, and
immediately called his friends; 'Come here,' he said;
'here are some curious things—letters of excommunication.'
He was beginning to read them, when
one of his companions cried out: 'Stop! for as soon as
you have read them, you will thereby be excommunicate!'
The worthy huguenot imagined that the best
plan was to know nothing about such anathemas,
and then to act as if the excommunication did not
exist—which could not be done if they were read.
Bonivard, a man of great good sense, profited by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">{465}</a></span>
opportunity to explain to his friends what these earthly
excommunications were worth. 'If you have done
what is wrong,' he told them, 'God himself excommunicates
you; but if you have acted rightly, the
excommunication of priests can do you no harm.
There is only one tribunal which has power over the
conscience, and that is heaven. The pope and the
devil hurt only those who are afraid of them. Do
therefore what is right, and fear nothing. The bolts
which they may hurl at you will be spent in the air.'
Then he added with a smile: 'If the pope or the metropolitan
of Vienne excommunicate you, pope Berthold
of Berne will give you absolution.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_763" id="Ref_763" href="#Foot_763">[763]</a></span>
 Bonivard's words
were repeated in Geneva, and the papal excommunications
lost credit every day.</p>

<p>This became alarming: the episcopal officers informed
the bishop; but the latter, who was enjoying
himself in his Burgundian benefices, put aside everything
that might disturb his meals and his repose. It
was not the same with the duke and his ministers.
That prince was not content with coveting the prelate's
temporal power; looking upon La Baume as already
dispossessed of his rights, he made himself bishop,
nay almost pope, in his place. The cabinet of Turin
thought that if the principles of civil liberty once
combined with those of religious liberty, Geneva would
attempt to reform Savoy by means of conversations,
letters, books, and missionaries. Charles III. therefore
sent a message to the council, which was read in
the Two-Hundred on the 7th of February. 'I hear,'
said the prince, 'that the Lutheran sect is making way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">{466}</a></span>
among you.... Make haste to prevent the ravages of
that pestilence, and, to that intent, send on the 17th two
men empowered by you to hear some very important
things concerning <i>my authority in matters of faith</i>.'</p>

<p>What would the Genevans answer? If a bishop is
made prince, why should not a prince be made bishop?
The confusion of the two provinces is a source of continual
disturbance. Christianity cannot tolerate either
Cæsars who are popes, or popes who are Cæsars; and
yet ambition is always endeavouring to unite these two
irreconcilable powers. The duke did not presume to
abolish definitively the episcopal power and confer it
on himself; but he wished to take advantage of the
bishop's flight to acquire an influence which he would
be able to retain when the episcopal authority was
restored. He spoke, therefore, like a Roman pontiff
... of his authority in matters of faith.</p>

<p>'Really,' said the council, 'we have had enough and
too much even of one pope, and we do not care to have
two—one at Rome and the other at our very gates.'
The citizens were so irritated at Charles's singular
claim, that they did not return an answer in the usual
form. 'We will not write to the duke,' said the
syndics; 'we will delegate no one to him, seeing that
we are not his subjects; but we will simply tell the
bearer of his letter that <i>we are going on very well</i>,
and that the duke, having no authority to correct us,
ought to <i>mind his own business</i>.' Such is the minute
recorded in the council register for this day. As for
La Baume, the poor prelate, who did not trouble himself
much either about pope or Lutheranism, wrote
the same day to the Genevans, that he permitted
them 'to eat milk-food during the coming Lent.' This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">{467}</a></span>
culinary permission was quite in his way, and it was
the most important missive from the bishop at that
time.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_764" id="Ref_764" href="#Foot_764">[764]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE DUKE REPRIMANDS THE CANONS.=</p>

<p>When the episcopal council heard of the syndics'
answer, they were in great commotion. They thought
it rude and unbecoming, and trembled lest Charles
should confound them with these arrogant burgesses.
They therefore sent M. de Veigy, one of the most
eminent canons, to the duke, in order to pacify him.
The reverend father set off, and while on the road, he
feared at one moment Charles's anger, and at another
enjoyed in anticipation the courtesies which the ducal
court could not fail to show him. But he had scarcely
been presented to the duke, and made a profound bow,
when Bishop de Belley, standing at the left of his
highness, and commissioned to be the interpreter of
his sentiments, addressed him abruptly, and, calling
him traitor and huguenot, insulted him just as De la
Thoy might have done. But this abuse was nothing
in comparison with Charles's anger: unable to restrain
himself, he burst out, and, giving utterance to the
terrible schemes he had formed against Geneva,
declared he would reduce that impracticable city to
ashes, and ended by saying: 'If you do not come out
of it, you will be burnt in it with all the rest.' The
poor canon endeavoured to pacify his highness: 'Ah,
my lord,' he said, 'I shall not remain there: all the
canons now in the city are about to leave it!' And
yet De Veigy was fond of Geneva, and thought that
to reside in Annecy would be terribly dull. Accordingly,
on his return to the city, he forgot his terror
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">{468}</a></span>
and his promises, whereupon he received this short
message from Charles III.: 'Ordered, under pain of
death, to quit Geneva in six days.'—'He left on the
3rd of March, and with great regret,' adds Balard.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_765" id="Ref_765" href="#Foot_765">[765]</a></span>
Charles wished to put the canons in a place of safety,
before he burnt the city.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">THE KNIGHTS OF THE SPOON LEAGUE AGAINST GENEVA
 AT THE CASTLE OF BURSINEL.<br />
 (<span class="smc">March 1528.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="side">=BONIVARD COMPLAINS OF GENEVA.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE partisans of absolutism and the papacy rose up
on every side against Geneva, as if the Reformation
were already established there. It was not so,
however. Although Geneva had come out of Romanism,
it had not yet entered Reform: it was still in
those uncertain and barren places, that land of negations
and disputes which lies between the two. A few
persons only were beginning to see that, in order to
separate really from the pope, it was necessary, as
Haller and Zwingle said, to obey Jesus Christ.
Bonivard, a keen critic, was indulging in his reflections,
in his large arm-chair, at the priory of St. Victor,
and carefully studying the singular aspect Geneva at
that time presented. 'A strange spectacle,' he said;
'everybody wishes to command, and no one will obey.
From tyranny we have fallen into the opposite and
worse vice of anarchy.... There are as many tyrants
as heads ... which engenders confusion. Everybody
wishes to make his own profit or private pleasure out
of the common weal; profit tends to avarice; and
pleasure consists in taking vengeance on him whom
you hate. Men are killed, but they are not the real
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">{470}</a></span>
enemies of Geneva.... If you wound a bear, he will not
spring upon the man who wounded him, but will tear
the first poles or the first tree in his way.... And
this, alas! is what they are doing among us. Having
groaned under a tyrannical government, we have the
love of licence instead of the love of liberty. We
must be apprentices before we can be masters, and
break many strings before we can play upon the lute.
The huguenots have driven out the tyrant, but have
not driven out tyranny. It is not liberty to do
whatever we desire, if we do not desire what is
right. O pride! thou wilt be the ruin of Geneva!
Pride has always envy for its follower; and when
pride would mount too high, the old crone catches
her by the tail and pulls her back, so that she falls
and breaks her neck.... The huguenot leagues are
not sufficient; the Gospel must advance, in order
that popery may recede.' It is Bonivard himself
who has transmitted these wise reflections.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_766" id="Ref_766" href="#Foot_766">[766]</a></span></p>

<p>He was not the only person who entertained such
thoughts. The affairs of the alliance often attracted
Bernese to Geneva; and being convinced that the
Reformation alone could save that city, they continued
Ab Hofen's work. Being admitted into private
families, they spoke against human traditions and
extolled the Scriptures. 'God speaks to us of the
Redeemer,' they said, 'and not of Lent.' But the
Friburgers, thrusting themselves into these evangelical
conferences, exclaimed: 'Obey the Church! If you
separate from the Church, we will break off the
alliance!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_767" id="Ref_767" href="#Foot_767">[767]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">{471}</a></div>

<p class="side">=BONIVARD'S ANSWER TO THE HUGUENOTS.=</p>

<p>The <i>bishopers</i> were with Friburg, the <i>commoners</i>
with Berne. The latter were divided into three
classes: there were politicians, to whom religion was
only a means of obtaining liberty; serious and peaceful
men, who called for true piety (Bonivard mentions
Boutelier as one of these); and, lastly, the enemies of
the priests, who saw the Reformation from a negative
point of view, and regarded it essentially as a war
against Roman superstitions. One day these sincere
but impatient men said they could wait no longer,
and went out to St. Victor to invite the prior to put
himself at their head. They rang at the gate of the
monastery, and the janitor went and told Bonivard,
who ordered them to be admitted: 'We wish to put
an end to all this papal ceremony,' they told him;
'we desire to drive out all its ministers, priests, and
monks ... all that papistical rabble; and then we
mean to invite the ministers of the Gospel, who
will introduce a true christian reformation among
us.'</p>

<p>The prior smiled as he heard these words: 'Gentlemen,'
he said, in a sarcastic tone, 'I think your
sentiments very praiseworthy, and confess that all
ecclesiastics (of whom I am one) have great need to be
reformed. But ought not those who wish to reform
others to begin by reforming themselves? If you love
the Gospel, as you say you do, you will live according
to the Gospel. But if you wish to reform us
without reforming yourselves, it is evident that you
are not moved by love for the Gospel, but by hatred
against us. And why should you hate us? It is not
because our manners are contrary to yours, but because
they are like them. Aristotle says in his <i>Ethics</i>,' continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">{472}</a></span>
the learned prior, 'and experience confirms
the statement, that animals which eat off the same
food naturally hate each other. Two horses do not
agree at the same manger, nor two dogs over the
same bone. It is the same with us. We are unchaste,
and so are you. We are drunkards, and so
are you. We are gamblers and blasphemers, and so
are you. Why then should you be so opposed to us?...
We do not hinder you from indulging in your
little pleasures; pray do the same by us. You desire
to expel us, you say, and put Lutheran ministers
in our place.... Gentlemen, think well of what you
are about: you will not have had them two years
before you will be sorry for it. These ministers will
permit you to break the commandments of the pope,
but they will forbid your breaking those of God.
According to their doctrines, you must not gamble
or indulge in debauchery, under severe penalty....
Ah! how that would vex you!... Therefore,
gentlemen, you must do one of two things: either
leave us in our present condition; or, if you wish to
reform us according to the Gospel, reform yourselves
first.'</p>

<p>These remarks were not quite so reasonable as they
appeared to be. <i>It is the sick that have need of a physician</i>,
and as these 'sons of Geneva' wished to invite
the ministers of the Gospel, <i>in order to introduce a
true christian reform</i>, Bonivard should have encouraged
instead of opposing them. These worldly
men might have had a real desire for the Gospel at
the bottom of their hearts. Reprimanded by the
prior, they withdrew. Bonivard watched them as
they retired. 'They are going off with their tails
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">{473}</a></span>
between their legs.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_768" id="Ref_768" href="#Foot_768">[768]</a></span>
Certainly, I desire a reformation;
but I do not like that those who are more qualified
to deform than to reform should presume to be
its instruments.'</p>

<p class="side">=DETERMINATION TO EAT MEAT IN LENT.=</p>

<p>When they got home, these huguenots deliberated
whether they would allow themselves to be stopped
by Bonivard's irony; they resolved to follow out his
precept—to reform themselves first; but, not knowing
that reformation consists primarily in reestablishing
faith and morality in the heart, they undertook simply
to prune away certain superstitions. As the episcopal
letter permitted them to take milk in Lent, De la
Maison-Neuve and his friends said: 'We are permitted
to take milk, why not meat?' Then repeating the
lesson which the Bernese had taught them—Do not the
Scriptures say, <i>Eat of all that is sold in the shambles</i>?—they
resolved to eat meat every day. The council saw
this with uneasiness, and forbade the new practice
under pain of three days' imprisonment on bread and
water and a fine of five sols.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_769" id="Ref_769" href="#Foot_769">[769]</a></span>
But wishing to hold
the balance even, they had hardly struck one side before
they struck the other, and condemned the forty-four
fugitive mamelukes to confiscation and death.</p>

<p>This last sentence aroused the anger of all the adjacent
country; the Sire de Pontverre, in particular,
thought the time had come for drawing the sword,
and immediately messengers were scouring the country
between the Alps and the Jura. They climbed
painfully up the rocky roads that led to the mountain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">{474}</a></span>
castles; they crossed the lake, everywhere summoning
the gentlemen, the friends of the mamelukes. The
knights did not need to be pressed; they put on their
armour, mounted their coursers, left their homes, and
proceeded towards the appointed rendezvous, the castle
of Bursinel, near Rolle, on the fertile slope which,
running out from the Jura, borders the lake opposite
Mont Blanc. These rough gentlemen arrived from La
Vaux, Gex, Chablais, Genevois, and Faucigny: one
after another they alighted from their horses, crossed
the courtyard, and entered the hall, which echoed with
the clash of their arms; then, shaking hands, they sat
down at a long table, where they began to feast. The
audacity of the Genevans was the principal subject of
conversation, 'and heaven knows how they of Geneva
were picked to pieces,' says a contemporary.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_770" id="Ref_770" href="#Foot_770">[770]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all these nobles, the most hostile to Geneva was
the Sire de Pontverre. Of athletic frame, herculean
strength, and violent character, bold and energetic,
he was, from his marked superiority, recognised as
their chief by the gentlemen assembled at the castle
of Bursinel. If these men despised the burgesses, the
latter returned the compliment. 'They are holding
a meeting of bandits and brigands at Bursinel,' said
some of the Genevans. We must not, however, take
these somewhat harsh words too literally. The depredations
of these gentlemen doubtless undermined
the social organisation, and it was time to put an end
to these practices of the middle ages. Many of them
were, however, good sons and husbands, good fathers,
and even good landlords; but they had no mercy for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">{475}</a></span>
Geneva. As they sat at table they said that the
princes had succeeded in France and elsewhere in
destroying the franchises of the municipal towns, and
that this free city, the last that survived, deserved a
similar fate much more than the others, since it was
beginning to add a new vice to its former vices ...
it was listening to Luther. 'A contest must decide,'
they added, 'whether the future times shall belong to
the knights or to the burgesses, to the Church or to
heresy.' If Geneva were overthrown, they thought
they would be masters of the future. Pontverre
has been compared to the celebrated Roman who
feared the Carthaginians, and, like him, never forgot
to repeat at every meeting of the nobles: <i>Delenda
Carthago</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_771" id="Ref_771" href="#Foot_771">[771]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE ORDER OF THE SPOON.=</p>

<p>The dinner was drawing to an end; the servants of
the lord of Bursinel had brought the best wines from
the castle cellars; the libations were numerous, and
the guests drank copiously. 'It chanced,' says Bonivard,
'that some rice (<i>papet</i>) was brought in, with
as many spoons as there were persons at table.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_772" id="Ref_772" href="#Foot_772">[772]</a></span>
Pontverre rose, took up a spoon with the same hand
that wielded the sword so vigorously, plunged it
into the dish of rice, and, lifting it to his mouth,
ate and said: 'Thus will I swallow Geneva and the
Genevese.' In an instant all the gentlemen, 'heated
with wine and anger,' took up their spoons, and exclaimed
as they ate, 'that they would make but one
mouthful of all the huguenots.' Pontverre did not
stop at this: he took a little chain, hung the spoon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">{476}</a></span>
round his neck, and said: 'I am a <i>knight of the Spoon</i>,
and this is my decoration.'—'We all belong to the
same order,' said the others, similarly hanging the
spoons on their breasts. They then grasped each
other's hands, and swore to be faithful to the last.
At length the party broke up; they mounted their
horses, and returned to their mansions; and when
their neighbours looked with surprise at what hung
round their necks, and asked what the spoon meant,
they answered: 'We intend to eat the Genevans with
it; will you not join us?' And thus the fraternity
was formed which had the conquest of Geneva for its
object.</p>

<p>The Spoon was taken up everywhere, as in the time
of the crusades men took up the Cross: the decoration
was characteristic of these loud-spoken free-living cavaliers.
Meetings took place every week in the various
castles of the neighbourhood. New members joined
the order, and hung the spoon round their necks, saying:
'Since the commonalty (the Genevans and Swiss)
form alliances, surely the nobles may do so!' They
drew up 'statutes and laws for their guidance, which
were committed to writing, as in public matters.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_773" id="Ref_773" href="#Foot_773">[773]</a></span>
Erelong the 'gentlemen of the Spoon,' as they called
themselves, proceeded to perform their vow; they
issued from their castles, plundered the estates of the
Genevans, intercepted their provisions, and blockaded
them closer and closer every day. When they came
near the city, on the heights of Pregny, Lancy, and
Cologny, they added derision to violence; they took
their spoons and waved them in the air, as if they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">{477}</a></span>
wished to use them in swallowing the city which
lay smiling at their feet.</p>

<p class="side">=ALARM AT GENEVA.=</p>

<p>The alarm increased every day in Geneva; the
citizens called the Swiss to their aid, fortified their
city, and kept strict watch. Whenever any friends
met together, the story of the famous dinner at Bursinel
was repeated. The Genevans went so far, says a
chronicle, as to be unwilling to make use of the innocent
spoon, such a horror they felt at it. Many of
those who read the Scriptures began to pray to God to
save Geneva; and on the 23rd of March, the council
entered the following words in their register: 'May
we be delivered from the evils we endure, may we
conquer and have peace!... May the Almighty be
pleased to grant it to us!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_774" id="Ref_774" href="#Foot_774">[774]</a></span></p>

<p>Pontverre was not a mere adventurer; he possessed
a mind capable of discerning the political defects of his
party. Two men in Geneva especially occupied his
thoughts at this time: they were the bishop and the
prior. In his opinion, they ought to gain the first and
punish the other.</p>

<p>He began with Bonivard; no one was more detested
by the feudal party than he was. That the head of a
monastery should side with the huguenots seemed
a terrible scandal. No one besides, at that time, advocated
more boldly than the prior the principles opposed
to absolute power; and this he showed erelong.</p>

<p>At Cartigny, on the left bank of the Rhone, about
two leagues from Geneva, he possessed a fief which depended
on the dukes of Savoy: 'It is a mere pleasure-house,
and not a fortress,' he said; and yet he was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">{478}</a></span>
the habit of keeping a garrison there. The duke had
seized it during his vassal's captivity, and to Bonivard's
frequent demands for its restoration he replied 'that
he dared not give it up for fear of being excommunicated
by the pope.' Michaelmas having come,
the time at which the rent was collected, the Savoy
government forbade the tenants to pay it to the prior;
the latter felt indignant, and the principles he then
laid down deserve to be called to mind. 'The rights
of a prince and his subjects are reciprocal,' he said.
'If the subject owes obedience to his prince, the prince
owes justice to his subject. If the prince may constrain
his subject, when the latter refuses obedience in
a case wherein it is lawfully due, the subject has also
the right to refuse obedience to his prince, when the
latter denies him justice. Let the subject then be
without fear, and rest assured that God is for him.
Men, perhaps, will not be on his side; but if he has
strength to resist men, I can answer for God.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_775" id="Ref_775" href="#Foot_775">[775]</a></span></p>

<p>Bonivard, who was determined to obtain justice,
laid before the council of Geneva the patents which
established his rights, and prayed their help in support
of his claim. His petition at first met with some
little opposition in the general council. 'The city has
enough to do already with its own affairs,' said many,
'without undertaking the prior's;' but most of the
huguenots were of a contrary opinion. 'If the duke
has at St. Victor a lord after his fashion,' they said,
'it might be a serious inconvenience to us. Besides,
the energetic prior has always been firm in the service
of the city.' This consideration prevailed and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">{479}</a></span>
general council decided that they would maintain
Bonivard's rights by force of arms if necessary.</p>

<p>The prior now made his preparations. 'Since I
cannot have civil justice,' he said, 'I will have recourse
to the law of nations, which authorises to repel
force by force.' The petty sovereign of St. Victor, who
counted ten monks for his subjects, who no longer
possessed his uncle's culverins, and whose only warlike
resources were a few arquebusiers, hired by a
Bernese adventurer, besides four pounds of powder,
determined to march against the puissant Duke of
Savoy, prince of Piedmont, and even to brave that
pope-king who once upon a time had only to frown to
make all the world tremble. Perish St. Victor rather
than principles!</p>

<p class="side">=BONIVARD DEFENDS CARTIGNY.=</p>

<p>Bonivard sent for a herald and told him: 'The
Duke of Savoy has usurped my sovereignty; you will
therefore proceed to Cartigny and make proclamation
through all my lordship, in these terms: "No one in
this place shall execute either ducal or papal letters
under pain of the gallows.'" We see that Bonivard
made a large use of his supreme power. The herald,
duly escorted, made the terrible proclamation round
the castle; and then a captain, a commissioner, and a
few soldiers, sent by Bonivard, took possession of the
domain in his name, <i>under the nose of the pope and the
duke</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_776" id="Ref_776" href="#Foot_776">[776]</a></span>
He was very proud of this exploit. 'The
pope and the duke have not dared send men to prevent
my captain from taking possession,' he said good-humouredly;
for Bonivard, though sparkling with
wit, was also a good-tempered man.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">{480}</a></div>

<p>The fear ascribed to the duke did not last long.
The lands of Cartigny were near those of Pontverre,
and the order of the Spoon was hardly organised when
an expedition directed against the castle was the prelude
to hostilities. A ducal provost, with some men-at-arms,
appeared before the place on the 6th of March,
1528. Bonivard had vainly told his captain to defend
himself: the place was taken. The indignant prior
exclaimed: 'My people allowed themselves to be surprised.'
He believed, as the Genevans also did, that
the duke had bribed the commandant: 'The captain
of Cartigny, after eating the fig, has thrown away the
basket,' said the huguenots in their meetings.</p>

<p>The prior of St. Victor, being determined to recover
his property from his highness's troops, came to an
understanding with an ex-councillor of Berne, named
Boschelbach, a man of no very respectable character,
who had probably procured him the few soldiers of his
former expedition, and who now, making greater exertions,
raised for him a corps of twenty men. Bonivard
put himself at the head of his forces, made them
march regularly, ordered them to keep their matches
lighted, and halted in front of the castle. The prior,
who was a clever speaker, trusted more to his tongue
than to his arms: he desired, therefore, first to explain
his rights, and consequently the ex-councillor, attended
by his servant Thiebault, went forward and demanded
a parley on behalf of the prior. By way of answer
the garrison fired, and Thiebault was shot dead.</p>

<p>That night all Geneva was agitated. The excited
and exasperated citizens ran armed up and down the
streets, and talked of nothing but marching out to
Cartigny to avenge Thiebault's death. 'Be calm,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">{481}</a></span>
said Boschelbach; 'I will make such a report to my
lords of Berne that Monsieur of Savoy, who is the
cause of all the mischief, shall suffer for it.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_777" id="Ref_777" href="#Foot_777">[777]</a></span>
The syndics had not promised to attack Savoy, which
would have been a serious affair, but only to defend
Bonivard. In order, therefore, to keep their word,
they stationed detachments of soldiers in the other
estates belonging to St. Victor, with orders to protect
them from every attack. Cartigny was quite lost to
the prior; but he was prepared to endure even greater
sacrifices. He had his faults, no doubt; and, in particular,
he was too easy in forming intimacies with
men far from estimable, such as Boschelbach; but he
had noble aspirations. He knew that by continuing
to follow the same line of conduct he would lose his
priory, be thrown into prison, and perhaps put to
death: 'But what does it matter,' he thought, 'if
by such a sacrifice right is maintained and liberty
triumphs?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_778" id="Ref_778" href="#Foot_778">[778]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=BISHOP AND DUKE RECONCILED.=</p>

<p>The lord of Pontverre was occupied with a scheme
far more important than Bonivard's destruction. He
wished, as we have said, to win back the bishop. Possessing
much political wisdom, seeing farther and more
clearly than the duke or the prelate, he perceived that
if the war against the new ideas was to succeed, it
would be necessary for all the old powers to coalesce
against them. Nothing, in his opinion, was more deplorable
than the difference between Charles III. and
Pierre de la Baume: he therefore undertook to reconcile
them. He showed them that they had both the
same enemies, and that nothing but their union would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">{482}</a></span>
put it in their power to crush the huguenots. He
frightened the bishop by hinting to him that the Reformation
would not only destroy Catholicism, but
strip him of his dignities and his revenues. He further
told him that heresy had crept unobserved into his
own household and infected even his chamberlain,
William de la Mouille, who at that time enjoyed his
entire confidence.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_779" id="Ref_779" href="#Foot_779">[779]</a></span>
La Baume, wishing to profit immediately
by Pontverre's information, hastened to
write to La Mouille: 'I will permit no opportunity
for breeding in my diocese any wicked and accursed
sect—such as I am told already prevails there. <i>You
have been too slow in informing me of it.</i>... Tell them
boldly that I will not put up with them.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_780" id="Ref_780" href="#Foot_780">[780]</a></span></p>

<p>The prelate's great difficulty was to become reconciled
with the duke. Having the fullest confidence
in his talent for intrigue, he thought that he
could return into friendly relations with his highness
without breaking altogether with Hugues and the
Genevans. 'He is a fine jockey,' said Bonivard; 'he
wants to ride one and lead the other by the bridle!'
The bishop began his manœuvres. 'I quitted Geneva,'
he informed the duke, 'in order that I might not be
forced to do anything displeasing to you.' It will be
remembered, on the contrary, that he had run away
to escape from Charles III., who wanted to 'snap him
up;' but that prince, satisfied with seeing La Baume
place himself again under his guidance, pretended to
believe him, and cancelled the sequestration of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">{483}</a></span>
revenues. Being thus reconciled, the bishop and the
duke set to work to stifle the Reformation. 'Good,'
said Bonivard; 'Pilate and Herod were made friends
together, for before they were at enmity between
themselves.'</p>

<p class="side">=BISHOP HATEFUL TO THE CITY.=</p>

<p>The bishop soon perceived that he could not be
both with the duke and Geneva; and, every day
drawing nearer to Savoy, he turned against his own
subjects and his own flock. And hence one of the
most enlightened statesmen Geneva ever possessed
said in the seventeenth century, to a peer of Great
Britain who had put some questions to him on the
history of the republic: 'From that time the bishop
became very hateful to the city, which could not but
regard him as a declared enemy.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_781" id="Ref_781" href="#Foot_781">[781]</a></span>
It was the bishop who tore the contract that had subsisted between
Geneva and himself.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER VII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">INTRIGUES OF THE DUKE AND THE BISHOP.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Spring and Summer 1528.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE first measure Charles exacted from his new
ally was to revoke the civil rights he had conceded
to the citizens. The bishop consented. In
order to deprive the secular magistrate of his temporal
privileges, he resolved to employ spiritual weapons.
Priests, bishops, and popes have always found their
use very profitable in political matters; princes of
great power have been known to tremble before the
documents launched into the world by the high-priest
of the Vatican. The bishop, therefore, caused an
order to be posted on the church doors, forbidding the
magistrates to try civil causes under pain of excommunication
and a fine of one hundred pounds of silver.
It seems that the bishop had thought it prudent to
attack the purses of those who were not to be frightened
by his <i>pastorals</i>. 'Remove these letters,' said
the syndics to the episcopal secretary, 'and carry
them back to the bishop, for they are contrary to our
franchises.' At the same time they said to the judges:
'You will continue to administer justice, notwithstanding
the excommunication.' This, be it remarked, occurred
at Geneva in the beginning of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">{485}</a></div>

<p class="side">=THE BISHOP AND THE SYNDICS.=</p>

<p>When informed of these bold orders, the bishop-prince
roused himself.... One might have fancied that
the spirit of Hildebrand and Boniface had suddenly
animated the weak La Baume. 'What! under the
pretence of maintaining your liberties,' he wrote to the
Genevans, 'you wish to usurp our sovereignty!...
Beware what you do, for if you persevere, we will
with God's help inflict such a punishment that it shall
serve for an example to others.... The morsel you
desire to swallow is harder to digest than you appear
to believe.... We command you to resign the administration
of justice; to receive the vidame whom the
duke shall be pleased to send you; to permit him to
exercise his power, as was done in the time of the
most illustrious princes his grace's predecessors; and
finally to remit to his highness and us the whole case
of the fugitives. If within a fortnight you do not
desist from all opposition to our authority, we will
declare you our enemies, and will employ all our
resources and those of our relations and friends to
punish you for the outrage you are committing against
us, and we will strive to ruin you totally, whatever
may be the place to which you flee.'</p>

<p>Great was the commotion in the city at hearing such
words addressed by the pastor of Geneva to his flock;
for if the bishop made use of such threats, it was with
the intention of establishing the authority of a foreign
prince among them. The true huguenots, who wanted
neither duke nor bishop, were silent under these circumstances,
and allowed the episcopal party, of which
Hugues was the chief, to act. Two ambassadors from
the bishop having been introduced before the general
council on the 14th of June, 1528, the premier syndic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">{486}</a></span>
said to them: 'If the bishop desires to appoint a
vidame to administer justice among us, we will accept
him; but the dukes of Savoy have never had other
than an unlawful authority in Geneva. We have no
prince but the bishop. Has he forgotten the great
misfortunes that have befallen the city in consequence
of these Savoyard vidames?... Citizens perpetually
threatened, many of them imprisoned and tortured,
their heads cut off, their bodies quartered.... But God
has helped us, and we will no longer live in such
misery.... No!' continued the speaker with some emotion,
'we will not renounce the independence which
our charters secure to us.... Rather than lose it, we
will sacrifice our lives and goods, our wives, and our
children.... We will give up everything, to our last
breath, to the last drop of our blood.'... Such words,
uttered with warmth, always excite the masses; and,
accordingly, as soon as the people heard them, they
cried as with one voice: 'Yes! yes! that is the answer
we will make.'</p>

<p>This declaration was immediately sent into Switzerland;
and, strange to say, such patriotic enthusiasm
was received with ridicule by some persons in that
noble country. Geneva was so small and so weak,
that her determination to resist a prince so powerful
as the duke seemed mere folly: the Swiss had forgotten
that their ancestors, although few in number,
had vanquished Austria and Burgundy. 'These
Genevans <i>are all mad</i>,' said they. When they heard
of this insult, the council of Geneva was content
to enter in its registers the following simple and
spirited declaration: 'Considering our ambassadors'
report of what the Swiss say of us, it is ordered that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">{487}</a></span>
they be written to and told that we <i>are all in our
right minds</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_782" id="Ref_782" href="#Foot_782">[782]</a></span></p>

<p>On hearing of these proceedings, La Baume, who
was at the Tour de May in Burgundy, flew into a
violent passion. He paced up and down his room,
abused his attendants, and uttered a thousand threats
against Geneva. He included all the Genevans in the
same proscription, and had no more regard for conservatives
like Besançon Hugues than for reformers like
Baudichon de la Maison-Neuve. He was angry with
the citizens who disturbed him with their bold speeches
in the midst of his peaceful retreat. 'In his opinion
the chief virtue of a prelate was to keep a plentiful and
dainty table, with good wines; and,' says a person who
often dined with him, 'he had sometimes more than he
could carry.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_783" id="Ref_783" href="#Foot_783">[783]</a></span>
He was, moreover, liberal to women of
doubtful character, very stately, and fond of great
parade.'</p>

<p class="side">=THE BISHOP AND THE MESSENGER.=</p>

<p>One day, as he was leaving the table where he had
taken too much wine, he was told that a messenger
from Geneva, bearing a letter from the council, desired
to speak with him. 'Messieurs de Genève, remembering,'
says Balard, 'that <i>dulce verbum frangit iram</i>,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_784" id="Ref_784" href="#Foot_784">[784]</a></span>
wrote to him in friendly terms.' The messenger,
Martin de Combes, having been admitted to the bishop,
bowed low, and, courteously approaching, handed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">{488}</a></span>
him the letters of which he was the bearer. But the
mere sight of a Genevan made the bishop's blood boil,
and, losing all self-control, he said 'in great fury:'
'Where do you come from?'—'From Geneva.'—'It
is a lie,' said the bishop; and then, forgetting that
he was contradicting himself, he added: 'You have
changed the colour of your clothes at Geneva;' wishing
apparently to accuse the Genevans of making a
revolution or a reformation. 'Come hither,' he continued;
'tell the folks in Geneva that they are all
traitors—all of them, men, women, and children, little
and big; that I will have justice done shortly, and
that it will be something to talk about. Tell them
never to write to me again.... Whenever I meet
any persons from that city, I will have them put to
death.... And as for you, get out of my sight instantly!'
The poor messenger, who trembled like a leaf, did not
wait to be told twice.</p>

<p>La Baume, who had forgotten Plutarch's treatise,
<i>De cohibenda ira</i>, could not recover from his emotion,
and kept walking up and down the room with agitated
step. Suddenly, remembering certain cutting expressions,
uttered in Switzerland by Ami Girard, a distinguished,
well-read, and determined huguenot, who
was generally envoy from Geneva to Berne and Friburg,
he said to his servants: 'Bring that man back.'
Poor De Combes was brought back like a criminal
whose rope has once broken, and who is about to be
hanged again. 'Mind you tell those folks at Geneva
all that I have ordered you,' exclaimed the bishop.
'There is one of them (I know him well—it is Ami
Girard) who said that I wish to bridle Geneva in order
that Monsieur of Savoy may ride her.... I will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">{489}</a></span>
revenged on him ... or I will die for it.... Out of
my sight instantly. Be off to your huguenots.'</p>

<p class="side">=CALM OF THE GENEVESE.=</p>

<p>De Combes retired without saying a word, and
reported in Geneva the prelate's violent message. He
had committed nothing to writing; but the whole scene
remained graven in his memory. 'What!' exclaimed
the huguenots, 'he said all that?' and then they made
him tell his story over again. The murmurs now
grew louder: the Genevans said that 'while in the
first centuries the ministers of the Church had conciliated
general esteem by their doctrine and character,
modern priests looked for strength in alliances with
the princes of this world; formerly the vocation of a
bishop was martyrdom, but now it is eating and drinking,
pomp, white horses, and ... bursts of anger.'
All this was a deadly blow to the consideration due to
the clergy. The council was, however, wiser than the
prelate; they ordered that no answer should be returned
him. This decision was indeed conformable
to custom, as the report had been made to the syndics
<i>viva voce</i>, and not by official letter. La Baume, at
the time he gave audience to the envoy from Geneva,
was too confused to hold a pen or to dictate anything
rational to his secretary; but the magistrates of
Geneva, on the other hand, were always men of rule
and law.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_785" id="Ref_785" href="#Foot_785">[785]</a></span></p>

<p>While the bishop was putting himself into a passion
like a soldier, the Duke of Savoy was convoking a
synod like a bishop. It was not enough for the evangelical
doctrine to <i>infect</i> Geneva—it was invading his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">{490}</a></span>
states. It already numbered partisans in Savoy, and
even the Alps had not proved a sufficient barrier
against the new invasion. Some seeds of the Gospel,
coming from Switzerland, had crossed the St. Bernard,
in despite of the opposition of the most zealous prelate
in Piedmont—we may even say in all Italy. This was
Pierre Gazzini, Bishop of Aosta, who was afterwards
to contend, in his own episcopal city, with the disciples
of Calvin, and with Calvin himself. Gifted with a
lofty intelligence, great energy of character, and ardent
catholicism, Gazzini was determined to wage war to
the death against the heretics, and it was in accordance
with his advice that a synod had been convoked.
When the assembly met on the 12th of July, 1528,
Gazzini drew a deplorable picture of the position.
'My lords,' he said, 'the news is distressing from
every quarter. Switzers and Genevans are circulating
<i>the accursed book</i>. Twelve gentlemen of Savoy adhere
scrupulously to the doctrines of Luther. All our
parishes between Geneva and Chambéry are infected
by forbidden books. The people will no longer pay
for masses or keep the fasts; men go about everywhere
saying that the property of the abbots and prelates
ought to be sold to feed the poor and miserable!'
Gazzini did not confine himself to pointing out the
disease; he sought for the cause. 'Geneva,' he said,
'is the focus,' and he called for the most violent
measures in order to destroy it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_786" id="Ref_786" href="#Foot_786">[786]</a></span>
The duke determined to employ every means to extinguish the fire,
'which (they said) was continually tossing its burning
flakes from Geneva into Savoy.'</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">{491}</a></div>

<p class="side">=SYNOD CONVOKED BY THE DUKE.=</p>

<p>Charles III. had been ruminating for some time
over a new idea. Seeing the difficulties that the
annexation of Geneva to Savoy would meet with on
the part of the Swiss, he had conceived another combination;
that is, to make his second son, a child four
years old, count or prince of Geneva. Circumstances
were favourable to this scheme. Pierre de la Baume
was designated successor to the Archbishop of Besançon;
he, doubtless, would not want much pressing to
give up his bishopric when he was offered an archbishopric.
The duke therefore sent commissioners to
the emperor and the pope to arrange the matter with
them. Hugues, ever ready to sacrifice himself to save
his country, started immediately, with three other
citizens, for Berne and Friburg; but he found the
confederates much cooled with regard to Geneva.
'You are very proud,' said the avoyer of Berne to
the envoys in full council, and, adds Hugues, 'they
gave us a good scolding.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_787" id="Ref_787" href="#Foot_787">[787]</a></span>
The duke had set every
engine to work, and, covetous as he was, had distributed
profusely his crowns of the sun. 'Ha!' said
the Genevan, 'Monsieur of Savoy never before sent so
much money here at one time,' and then sarcastically
added, with reference to the lords of Berne: 'The <i>sun</i>
has blinded them.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_788" id="Ref_788" href="#Foot_788">[788]</a></span></p>

<p>The Genevans found themselves alone; the monarchical
powers of Christendom—Piedmont, France,
and the Empire—were rising against their dawning
liberty; even the Swiss were forsaking them; but not
one of them hesitated. Ami Girard and Robert Vandel,
at that time ambassadors to Switzerland, quivered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">{492}</a></span>
with indignation, and, filled with an energy that reminds
us of old Rome, they wrote to their fellow-citizens:
'Sooner than do what they ask you, set fire
to the city, and <i>begin with our houses</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_789" id="Ref_789" href="#Foot_789">[789]</a></span></p>

<p>The duke now prepared to support his pretensions
by more energetic means. His agents traversed the
districts round Geneva; they went from door to door,
from house to house, and said to the peasants: 'Do
not venture to carry provisions to Geneva.' Others
went from castle to castle, and told the lords: 'Let
every gentleman equip his followers with uniform and
arms, and be ready at the sound of the alarm-bell.'</p>

<p class="side">=DUCAL INTRIGUES IN THE CONVENTS.=</p>

<p>But the duke did not confine his intrigues to the
outside of the city; he employed every means inside.
Gentlemen of Savoy made visits, gave dinners, and
tampered with certain private persons, promising them
a great sum of money 'if they would do <i>their duty</i>.'
The monks, feeling assured that their knell would ring
erelong, redoubled their efforts to secure the triumph
of Savoy in Geneva. Three of them, Chappuis, superior
of the Dominicans, a man deep in the confidence of
his highness, who had lodged in his monastery, with
Gringalet and Levrat, simple monks, held frequent conferences
in the convent of Plainpalais, in the prior's
chamber, round a table on which lay some little silver
keys; by their side were lists containing the names of
the principal Genevese ecclesiastics and laymen from
whom Chappuis believed he might hope for support.
The three monks took up the keys, looked at them
complacently, and then placed them against certain
names. The duke, knowing that intrigue and vanity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">{493}</a></span>
are the original sins of monks, had sent the prior these
keys (the arms of Faucigny, a province hostile to
Geneva): 'Procure for us friends in the convents and
the city,' he had told them; 'and for that purpose distribute
these keys with discretion. Whoever wears
them will belong to us.' It was a mysterious decoration,
by means of which the duke hoped to gain partisans
for the annexation. Chappuis and Levrat began
to tamper with the laity of the city, while Gringalet
undertook to gain the monks. In spite of all the
skill they employed, their manœuvres were not always
crowned with success. One day Gringalet went up to
two monks, Bernard and Nicholas, and showed them
the talisman; but they looked coldly on such <i>toys</i>, manifesting
no desire to possess them. The ducal monk,
perceiving that the keys had no virtue, said to his
colleagues: 'If we do not succeed in our scheme; if
Savoy and the papacy do not triumph in Geneva, we
will abandon the ungrateful city; we will transfer the
property of our convent to some other place, and leave
nothing but the bare walls behind!' Bernard and
Nicholas, who inclined to the side of light, were
alarmed, and, judging it to be a matter of high importance,
denounced the plot to the council: 'This,
then, is the use of monks,' said the syndics. 'They
are traitors, ready to deliver the city to the foreigner.
We will put all to rights.' They ordered the two
monks to say nothing, and when night came the
council proceeded to the Dominican monastery. The
beadles knocked at the gate; the porter opened it, and
looked with astonishment at the noble company. The
syndics ordered all the convent to assemble. The
monks were greatly alarmed: Chappuis, Gringalet, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">{494}</a></span>
Levrat trembled, having no doubt that they had been
betrayed. They made haste to hide the little keys, and
then proceeded anxiously to the common hall, where
the brethren had already assembled: 'We have heard of
your intrigues,' said the premier syndic; 'we know
why you are distributing in Geneva the keys of those
Turks (<i>Turcanorum</i>), the Faucignerans.... You had
better say your prayers and not meddle with politics.
You pretend to renounce the world, reverend brethren,
and then do nothing else but intrigue for the things of
this world. You intend, we hear, to carry away your
property, your relics, and your jewels; gently ... we
will spare you that trouble; we will take care of them
in the grotto of St. Pierre, and put your persons in a
place of safety.'... The council ordered an inventory
of the goods of the convent to be drawn up, and
generously left the monks three chalices for the celebration
of mass. They banished Chappuis, Gringalet,
and Levrat, and placed the other brethren under the
surveillance of two deputies of the council. The
monks had their wings clipped, and the Reformation
was beginning.<span

<p class="side">=PONTVERRE MOWS FOR BONIVARD.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">CHAPPUIS, Gringalet, and Levrat filled the places
through which they passed with their complaints,
and all the bigots looked upon them as martyrs.
The knights of the Spoon, being informed of the fate
with which monastic institutions were threatened in
Geneva, resolved to avenge religion and do all the
injury they could to the audacious burgesses. Pontverre
had already opened the campaign by a little
scene of pillage, which is of no importance except to
show the manners of the age. Wishing to spoil and
plunder the Genevans <i>under their noses</i>, he had ordered
his tenants to sharpen their scythes. One day in
the beginning of June, the peasants shouldered their
scythes; Pontverre put himself at their head, his men-at-arms
surrounded them, and all marched towards
the meadows of the Genevans on the left bank of the
Arve, about a quarter of an hour's walk from the city.
The mowers arrived, whetted their instruments, and
then proceeded to cut down the new grass. At last
they came to a meadow which belonged to Bonivard:
to rob the prior was a <i>dainty thing</i> for Pontverre.
Meanwhile the Genevans, having heard of what was
going on, had hurried to the spot, and discovered by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">{496}</a></span>
the side of the mowers a body of men whose arms
flashed in the rays of the sun. Bonivard easily recognised
the seigneur of Ternier. The huguenots could
hardly contain themselves. The chief of the knights
of the Spoon, having charged his people not to leave a
blade of grass standing, approached the bridge of Arve
which separates the two countries, and, calling out to
the Genevans assembled on the right bank, began to
insult and defy them. 'Come, come, cheer up!' he said;
'why don't you cross the bridge and fetch the hay we
have cut for you?' The citizens loaded their arms,
and the two bands began to fire at each other with their
arquebuses. 'Let us take him at his word,' said some
of the huguenots; 'let us go over the bridge and drive
away the robbers.' Already several young men were
preparing to cross the river; but Bonivard did not
think a few loads of hay worth the risk of a battle
that might not end well for Geneva. 'I dissuaded
them,' says he, 'and led them back to the city.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_791" id="Ref_791" href="#Foot_791">[791]</a></span></p>

<p>The Genevans, seeing the danger with which they
were threatened by the knights, energetically prepared
for resistance, and solicited aid from Berne and Friburg.
Two <i>enseignes</i>, that is, eight hundred men,
principally from Gessenay, arrived in Geneva and were
quartered among the inhabitants, but especially on
the churchmen and in the convents. The duke, who
attached great importance to the Swiss alliance, and
feared to come into collision with their men-at-arms,
now permitted provisions to be carried to the market
of Geneva, and, the semblance of peace having been
restored, the allied troops quitted the city on the 30th
of October, 1528.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">{497}</a></div>

<p class="side">=THE MEETING AT NYON.=</p>

<p>Pontverre's humour was not so pacific. One of the
last representatives of feudal society, he saw that its
elements were on the verge of dissolution, and its
institutions about to disappear. Power, which had
long ago passed from the towns to the country, was
now returning from the country to the towns; Geneva,
in particular, seemed as if it would nullify all the
seigneurs in its neighbourhood. And, further still,
the Church which puts forward creeds in an absolute
manner, so that no person has the right to examine
them, was attacked by the religious revolution beginning
in Geneva. Pontverre desired to preserve the
ancient order of things, and, with that object, to take
and (if necessary) destroy that troublesome city. He
therefore, as prior of the order, convened a general assembly
of the knights of the Spoon at Nyon, in order
to arrange, in concert with the duke, the requisite
measures for capturing the city. The bailiwick of
Ternier, the lordship of Pontverre, was situated about
a league from Geneva, between the verdant flanks of
the Salève and the smiling shores of the Rhone. It
would have been easy, therefore, for that chief to
cross the river between Berney and Peney, and thus
get on the right bank of the lake; but he thought it
more daring and heroic to traverse Geneva. They
represented to him, but to no purpose, the danger to
which he would expose himself, for if he was always
quick to provoke the Genevans, they were equally
quick to reply. Pontverre would listen to nothing.
There was a treaty by which Savoyard gentlemen had
the right of free passage through the city; and, armed
with a sword, he feared nobody. It was in the month
of December, when, presenting himself at daybreak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">{498}</a></span>
at the Corraterie gate, Pontverre passed in; he rode
quietly through the city, looking to the right and to
the left at the shops which were still closed, and did
not meet a single huguenot. On arriving at the Swiss
gate, by which he had to leave the city, he found it
shut. He summoned the gate-keeper, who, as it appears,
was not yet up. The horse pawed the ground,
the rider shouted, and the porter loitered: he ran out
at last and lowered the chain. The impatient Pontverre
paid him by a slap in the face, and said: 'Rascal,
is this the way you make gentlemen wait?' He then
added with violent oaths: 'You will not be wanted
much longer. It will not be long before we pull down
your gates and trample them under foot, as we have
done before.' He then set spurs to his horse and
galloped away. The porter, exasperated by the blow
he had received, made his report, and the Genevans,
who were irritable folk, became very angry about it.
'It is not enough,' they said, 'for these Savoyards
to do us all sorts of injury outside the walls, but they
must come and brave us within. Wait a little! We
will pay them off, and chastise this insolent fellow.'
The council, while striving to restrain the people,
ordered sentinels to be stationed everywhere.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_792" id="Ref_792" href="#Foot_792">[792]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CONFERENCE AT NYON.=</p>

<p>The gentry of the district who had taken part in the
meeting at Bursinel, had immediately begun to canvass
their neighbours, and a great number of persons,
incensed against Geneva, had taken the Spoon, as in
the time of the crusades men took the Cross. The
second meeting, therefore, promised to be more numerously
attended than the first. From all quarters, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">{499}</a></span>
Gex and Vaud and Savoy, the knights arrived at
Nyon, a central situation for these districts, where
they usually held their councils of war. Climbing the
hill, they entered the castle, from whose windows the
lake, its shores, and the snowy Alps of Savoy were
visible in all their magnificence. Having taken their
places in the great hall, they began their deliberations.
These unpolished gentlemen, descended from the chevaliers
of the middle ages, who thought it enough to build
a tower upon a rock and to pass their lives in crushing
the weak and plundering the innocent, still preserved
something of the nature of their ancestors. Pontverre,
who was their president, had no difficulty in carrying
them with him. Feudalism and even catholicism
exercised great influence over him, and gave to his
words an energy and deep conviction which it was
hard to resist. He pointed out to these lords that the
authority of the prince and of the pope, religious and
monarchical order, the throne and the altar, were
equally threatened by an insolent bourgeoisie. He
showed them how monstrous it was that lawyers, that
men of low birth and no merit, and that even shopkeepers
should presume to take the place of the bishop
and the duke. 'We must make haste,' he said, 'to
disperse and crush the seeds of rebellion, or you will
see them spreading far and wide.' The knights of the
castle of Nyon were unanimous. The right of resistance
had been the characteristic of the feudal
system; and never had the exercise of that right been
more necessary. One lord exercised it in the middle
ages against another lord, his neighbour. But what
were these isolated adversaries compared with that
universal and invisible enemy which threatened the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">{500}</a></span>
old society in all its parts, and which, to be surer of
triumph, was inaugurating a new religion? In the
valley of the Leman, Geneva was the stronghold of
this new and terrible adversary. 'Down with Geneva!
Rome and Savoy for ever!' was the cry that rose from
every heart. It was agreed that all the gentlemen
and their followers should meet at a certain time and
place, armed with sword and lance, in order to seize
upon the city and put an end to its liberties.</p>

<p>Pontverre, delighted at seeing the success of his
appeal, sat silent, and appeared for a time lost in deep
meditation. He had a subtle mind, he did not fear to
resort to stratagem, and hoped that an assault would
not be necessary. With the greatest secresy he had
gained friends who occupied a house in the Corraterie,
the back door of which opened to the outside of the
city. It would seem that this house belonged to the
hospital of the Pont du Rhone, situated between that
bridge and the Mint, and placed under the patronage
of the canons of the cathedral.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_793" id="Ref_793" href="#Foot_793">[793]</a></span>
The council rose.
Pontverre was particularly intimate with the Sire de
Beaufort, governor of Chillon, one of the most valiant
knights of the assembly. Taking him aside, and enjoining
secresy, he said: 'We have a gate in Geneva at
our orders. No one knows of it; but do not fear. I will
undertake that you shall all enter.'—'Pontverre did
indeed enter,' said Bonivard, some time after, when
he heard of this remark; 'he went in, but he did not
come out.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_794" id="Ref_794" href="#Foot_794">[794]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=PONTVERRE'S INSOLENCE.=</p>

<p>The knights mounted their horses, and each one
rode off to his castle to prepare for the great enterprise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">{501}</a></span>
Pontverre did the same; but, always daring,
and taking a delight in braving the people of Geneva,
he resolved to pass through the city again. His
friends reminded him that the citizens were now on
their guard; that he had offended them some days
before; that if he attempted such an imprudent act,
he was a dead man; and that his life was necessary
to their enterprise. It was all to no purpose. 'His
hour was come,' says the chronicler of St. Victor,
'and it pleased God so.'—'Fear not,' answered the
daring soldier to his brothers in arms; 'I will pass
through by night, and wrap my face up in my cloak,
so that no one can recognise me. Besides, if they
attack me, I have my sword.' One of his friends, the
Sire de Simon, resolved to accompany him, and some
armed attendants followed them. The knights who
remained behind, watched him as he galloped off
towards Geneva, and wondered anxiously what would
happen.</p>

<p>Pontverre, checking the speed of his horse, reflected
on the work he was about to undertake. He
thought it worthy of the name he bore, and of the
memory of his ancestors. By lending his sword to
the Duke of Savoy and to the pope, he would make
absolutism in the Church and in the State triumphant
in Geneva; at one blow he would crush in that restless
city both independence and the Reformation.
He reached Geneva between four and five o'clock in
the afternoon of Saturday, the 2nd of January, 1529,
and night had set in. Pontverre hid his face in his
cloak, presented himself with his escort at the Pâquis
gate, and passed through. He entered the streets.
The commander of an army which purposed capturing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">{502}</a></span>
and destroying Geneva, was traversing, like an ordinary
traveller, the city he was about to surround
with his forces, besiege, and perhaps burn.... Such
impudent assurance has perhaps never been witnessed
in modern times. He was hardly inside the city,
when, no longer able to contain himself (for pride
and anger prevailed over discretion), he put aside
all precaution, threw off his cloak, and, drawing
his sword, 'uttered threats and insults out of his
haughtiness and insolence.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_795" id="Ref_795" href="#Foot_795">[795]</a></span>
He went even further
than this: the streets of Geneva, and the presence of
the detested huguenots whom he saw moving about,
made his wrath boil over; and striking one of the
citizens on the head with his sword, he exclaimed with
a round oath: 'We must kill these traitors!' The
assaulted citizen turned round, and others ran up:
this took place in the Rue de Coutance, which has
witnessed many other fights since then, even in
very recent times.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_796" id="Ref_796" href="#Foot_796">[796]</a></span>
The huguenots surrounded the
horseman, and, recognising him, called out: 'It is
Pontverre! it is Pontverre!' The crowd increased
and blocked up the bridge over the Rhone, which
the chief of the knights of the Spoon would have to
cross.</p>

<p class="side">=FIGHT ON THE BRIDGE.=</p>

<p>For several days past the citizens had been talking
in Geneva about the conference at Nyon; they said
that these gentlemen of the Spoon were planning
some new attack, that they were going once more to
plunder and kill, and that this time they would probably
try to carry fire and sword into Geneva itself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">{503}</a></span>
The irritation was excessive among the people; some
of the citizens, meeting in the public places or in
their own houses, were talking about the gentlemen
assembled at Nyon, and many jokes were made upon
them. 'These gentlemen!' said one huguenot. 'Call
them rob-men (<i>gens-pille-hommes</i>),' said a second; 'or
kill-men (<i>gens-tue-hommes</i>),' added a third; and despite
the serious state of affairs, they all began to laugh.
On a sudden, here before them, in their very city, was
the leader of the enterprise, the man who never ceased
harassing them: he had drawn his sword and struck
one of the citizens. The latter drew in their turn,
and just as the bold cavalier had crossed the suburb
of St. Gervais, and was coming upon the bridge, they
surrounded him, and one of them struck him in the
face. The representative of feudalism was fighting
almost alone with the representatives of the bourgeoisie.
The old power and the new were struggling
on the Rhone bridge. And while the blue waters
were flowing beneath, as they had ever done; while
the old waters were running on to be lost in the sea,
and the new ones were coming, loosened from the
Alpine glaciers by the beams of the sun,—on the bridge
above there were other ancient things passing away,
and other new ones appearing in their place. Amid
the flashing of swords and the shock of arms, amid
the indignant shouts of the citizens and the oaths of
the knight, a great transformation was going on;
society was passing over to the system of freedom
and abandoning the system of feudalism.</p>

<p>The Sire de Pontverre, seeing the number of his
enemies increasing, spurred his horse, dashed through
the crowd, and reached the Corraterie gate, by which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">{504}</a></span>
he desired to leave the city, and which led to the
Black Friars' monastery. But the Genevans had got
there before him.... The gate, alas! was shut. In
this extremity, Pontverre did not falter. Close at
hand was the house, dependent on the hospital, the
back gate of which led outside the city, and by which
he designed introducing the Savoyards by night.
Thanks to his horse, he was a little in advance of his
pursuers; he lost not a moment, he turned back, and
reached the house in question. To get at the door it
was necessary to go up several steps. The Genevans
were now rushing after him in a crowd, shouting:
'Pontverre! Pontverre!'... The latter faced his
enemies, and, without dismounting, backed his horse
up the steps, at the same time using his sword against
his pursuers. At this moment the syndic Ami
Girard arrived; he found the Sire de Simon, and
the other horsemen who had accompanied their chief,
beset on all sides. The syndic begged that they
might not be hurt; and as the horsemen surrendered
their arms, they were lodged in a place of
safety. Pontverre dismounted on reaching the top
of the steps, and, hoping to escape by the door we
have mentioned, rushed into the house. His face
was covered with blood, for, says an eye-witness, 'he
had a sword-cut on his nose;' his eyes were wild;
he heard the feet of the huguenots close behind him.
Had he no time to reach the door, or did he find it
shut? We cannot tell. Seeing that he could not
escape, he appears to have lost his presence of mind.
Had he still been himself, he would no doubt have
faced his enemies and sold his life dearly, but, for the
first time in his life, he became frightened; he dashed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">{505}</a></span>
into one of the apartments, threw himself on the
floor, and crept hastily under a bed: a child might
have done the same. What a hiding-place for the
most valiant knight whom the Alps and the Jura had
seen perhaps for centuries!</p>

<p class="side">=THE DEATH-STRUGGLE.=</p>

<p>At this moment, the Genevans who were pursuing
him rushed into the house and began to search it;
they entered the room where the man lay hid who had
threatened to swallow Geneva as if it were a spoonful
of rice. At their head was Ami Bandière, one of the
huguenots who had been compelled to flee to Berne
at the same time as Hugues and the leaders of the
party—the man, it will be remembered, whose father
and children had appeared before the council in
1526, when it was necessary to defend the huguenots
who had taken refuge in Switzerland. Bandière, an
upright, determined, and violent man, an enthusiast
for liberty, noticed the bed; he thought that the
proud gentleman might possibly be hidden beneath
it. 'They poked their swords underneath,' says
Bonivard, 'and the wretched man hidden there received
a stab.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_797" id="Ref_797" href="#Foot_797">[797]</a></span>
This was too much: the Sire de
Pontverre was aroused: being an active and powerful
man, he rushed out of his hiding-place in a fury, and,
springing to his feet, seized Bandière with his vigorous
arms, threw him on the bed, and stabbed him in
the thigh with a dagger. The shouts now grew
louder. If he had surrendered no harm would have
been done him; but Bandière's friends, excited by
the blood of their brother, were eager to avenge him.
They rushed upon Pontverre. Alone in the middle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">{506}</a></span>
of the room, this athletic man received them boldly:
he swung his sword round him, now striking with the
edge, and now with the point; but a citizen, inflamed
by anger, aimed a violent blow at him, and the captain-general
of the knights of the Spoon fell dead. At
this moment the syndic Ami Girard entered, exclaiming:
'Stop! stop!' but it was too late.</p>

<p>Thus died François de Ternier, lord of Pontverre,
whose ancestors had always been enemies of Geneva,
'and who himself had been the worst,' says one of his
contemporaries. He fell a martyr to feudalism, say
some; a victim to his own insolence, say others. His
sole idea had been to ruin Geneva, to disperse its inhabitants,
to throw down its walls; and now he lay
dead a few yards from the place where, in 1519, he was
present at the head of his troopers to take part in the
murder of Berthelier, and in the very place by which
he had arranged to enter and destroy the city by fire
and sword.—'A memorable instance of divine justice,'
said some of the citizens; 'a striking deliverance for
Geneva; a terrible lesson for its enemies!' There is
a great difference, it must be observed, between the
martyrs of liberty and right, and those of feudalism
and the papacy. Arbitrary power perfidiously seized
the greatest citizens, the Bertheliers and Lévriers, in
the midst of an inoffensive life, and put them to death
by the vile hand of the common headsman, after a
sham trial, which was a disgraceful mockery of justice;
but it was only when provoked by the champions
of feudalism, and at the risk of their own lives,
that the men of liberty struck their adversaries. Pontverre
died in a contest in which he had been the first
to draw the sword.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">{507}</a></div>

<p class="side">=HONOURS TO THE DEAD.=</p>

<p>As the Genevans wished to show every mark of respect
to their dead enemy, the council ordered that he
should be buried with the usual rites by the Franciscans
in a chapel of the convent of Rive, which had
been founded by his family, and where some of his
ancestors had been laid. After this ceremony had taken
place according to the forms of the Roman ritual, an
inquest was made into the cause of this tragical death,
'to do justice therein, if there should be need.' All
the cool-headed people in Geneva were seriously
grieved: 'Alas!' said they, 'what a pity that he
would not live in peace, for he was a virtuous cavalier,
except that he was so pugnacious! It would
have been better to make him prisoner; it would have
been the means of obtaining a perpetual treaty!' The
officers of justice found letters on his person which
had reference to the plot hatched against Geneva, and
in which the knights of the Spoon were ordered to
assemble 'with swords and spears' against the city.
It was made evident that he had been the chief of the
bands which pillaged and killed without mercy the
citizens and inhabitants of the country, and that he
was to blame, having first wounded Bandière: the
magistrates, therefore, came to the conclusion that
there were no grounds for bringing any one to trial.
The Sire de Simon and the other companions of the
famous captain were conducted uninjured to the frontier
of Savoy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_798" id="Ref_798" href="#Foot_798">[798]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">{508}</a></div>

<p>One would have thought that, as the head of the
league against Geneva had fallen, the league itself
would have been weakened; but, on the contrary,
Pontverre's death added fuel to the rage of the
brethren of the Spoon. Disorder and violence increased
around the city, and the very next day, Sunday,
the 3rd of January, the gentry, wishing to avenge
their chief, kept the field everywhere. 'We will kill all
the Genevans we can find,' said they.—'They fell upon
the first they met, committing violence and murder.'
It seemed as if Pontverre's soul had revived, and was
impelling his former colleagues to offer sacrifices without
number to his shade. An early attack was expected;
the alarm spread through Geneva, and the
council met. 'François de Ternier's death,' said one
of the members, 'has thrown oil upon the fire instead
of extinguishing it. Alone, we cannot resist the attack
of Savoy and of the knights. Let us make haste to
inform Berne and Friburg.'—'It is impossible,' said
another councillor; 'all the gentlemen of Vaud are in
arms; no one can cross the province. Our envoys
would be stopped at Versoy, Coppet, Nyon, and Rolle;
and whoever is taken will be put to death to avenge
the fall of the illustrious chief.'</p>

<p>But a free people always finds citizens ready to
sacrifice themselves. Two men stood up: they were
two of the bravest huguenots, Jean Lullin and Robert
Vandel. 'We will go,' they said. They embraced their
relatives, and got into a boat, hoping to reach some
place on the lake where they could land without danger.
But they had hardly left the shore when they were
recognised and pursued by some of the enemies' boats,
well manned and armed. As soon as the two Genevans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">{509}</a></span>
observed them, they saw their danger, and, catching
up the spare oars, assisted the boatmen with their
vigorous arms, and rowed off as fast as they could.
They kept gaining on the Savoyard boats; they passed
unmolested within sight of several harbours occupied
by their enemies, and at last reached Ouchy, dripping
with perspiration. The people of Lausanne, who were
well disposed towards the Genevans, assisted them.
They got to Friburg, 'by subtle means,' probably in
disguise, and told their old friends of the increasing
dangers to which the city was exposed, especially
since the death of Pontverre.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_799" id="Ref_799" href="#Foot_799">[799]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE SIRE DE VIRY.=</p>

<p>The place of the latter was now filled by the Sire
de Viry, whose castle, like Pontverre's, was situated
between Mont Salève and the lake (between Chancy
and Léluiset), and whose family had always supplied
Savoy with fanatical partisans. Viry was furious at
the escape of Lullin and Vandel; and, accordingly, on
the next day, the servants of these two Genevans,
who had been ordered to take their masters' horses to
Lausanne, having passed through Coppet, were thrown
into prison by his orders. He did not stop at this.
'The gentlemen assaulted every Genevan they met
with their daggers and battle-axes, striking them on
the loins, the shoulders, and other parts, and many
died thereof.'—'All the territory of Monseigneur of
Savoy is in arms,' said people at Geneva in the beginning
of March 1529, 'and no one can leave the city
except at great risk.'</p>

<p>The ducal party, desirous of defying the Genevans
in every way, resolved to send them, not a written but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">{510}</a></span>
a living message, which would show them the fate
that awaited them. On the 14th of March, the people
who were leaving the church of Our Lady of Grace,
saw a strange figure coming over the bridge of Arve.
He had at his back a wooden plank reaching from his
feet to above his head, to which he was fastened; while
his outstretched arms were tied to a cross piece which
was placed on a level with his shoulders. The gentlemen
had thought it a pretty jest to crucify a Genevan,
without doing him any great injury, and they left his
feet at liberty, so that he could return home thus
singularly arrayed. 'What is that?' asked the people,
stopping at the foot of the bridge. They thought they
recognised an inhabitant of the city. 'They have
made a cross of him front and back,' said the spectators.
The man came over the bridge, approached his
fellow-citizens, and told them his story. 'I had gone
to the village of Troinex on business, when the enemy
caught me, trussed me up in this manner, and compelled
me to return in this condition to Geneva.' The
people hardly knew whether to laugh or be angry;
however, they unbound their crucified fellow-citizen,
and all returned together to the city.</p>

<p>This was only a little joke of the young ones among
the knights; the Sire de Viry and his colleagues had
more serious thoughts. The attack upon Geneva, resolved
upon at the castle of Nyon, was to be put into
execution. The lords issued with their armed retainers
from all the castles in the great valley, and on
the 24th of March some peasants from the banks of
the Arve came and told the syndics that there was a
great concourse of gentlemen and soldiers at Gaillard;
that these armed men intended on the following night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">{511}</a></span>
to secretly scale the walls of the city, and that there
was a strong guard upon all the roads to detain everybody
who ventured out of Geneva. At that time the
whole garrison consisted but of fifty soldiers, 'keeping
watch and ward by turns,' as Bonivard informs
us. How was it possible to resist with such a few
men? Yet two powers kept the walls: the energy of
the citizens and the providence of God.</p>

<p class="side">=THE DAY OF THE LADDERS.=</p>

<p>At midnight on Holy Thursday (25th of March),
the knights of the Spoon, with about four thousand
Savoyard troops and the fugitive mamelukes, moved
forward as secretly as possible to take Geneva by
surprise. The citizens, accustomed to false alarms,
had not paid much attention to the warning they had
received. At the head of the band that was to lead
the assault were a certain number of men carrying long
ladders which had been made at Chillon. The men-at-arms
who followed them wore white shirts over
their armour in order to be recognised in the darkness;
they had even sent to their friends in Geneva
certain tokens which the latter were to fasten to the
ends of their spears in order that the assailants might
know them in the confusion. The city clocks had
struck two when a few Savoyards arrived at the foot
of the wall: not a sound was heard, the night was dark,
and everything promised complete success. Meanwhile
the main body had halted a quarter of a league
from the city, and hesitated to make the attack.
Pontverre was no longer among them, and Viry had
not inherited his influence. 'At the moment of execution,
a spirit of fear fell upon the Savoyards,' says a
chronicler; 'God took away their courage, so that they
were not able to come near.'—'We are not strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">{512}</a></span>
enough to carry out our enterprise,' said one.—'If we
fail,' said another, 'Messieurs of the Swiss League will
not fail us.' They consequently withdrew, and, in
order to conceal their disgrace, said that the duke or
the bishop had forbidden them to advance. Might not
the duke, influenced by the cantons, have really given
them the order to retreat at the last moment? That
alone appears to explain this retrograde movement.
However, the Genevans ascribed their deliverance to a
higher cause; they entered on the registers of the
council the following simple words which we copy:
'The gentlemen (<i>gentils</i>) had undertaken to attack the
city, <i>which God has preserved hitherto</i>.' The 25th of
March was called <i>the day of the ladders</i>.<span

 <span style="font-size:80%">THE REFORMATION BEGINS TO FERMENT IN GENEVA, AND THE
 OPPOSITION WITHOUT.<br />
 (<span class="smc">April 1529 to January 1530.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="side">=SUPERSTITIONS IN GENEVA.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHILE the men of the old times were taking
fright and retreating, the men of the new
times were taking courage and advancing. They
sat down at the firesides of the burgesses of Geneva,
and, leading the way to religious conversation, gradually
scattered new ideas in the city and new seed
in men's hearts. Of these <i>Lutherans</i>, as they were
called, some were Genevans, others Bernese; and the
witty Bonivard occasionally joined in this familiar
talk. Some of them, truly pious men, told their listeners
that they ought to look for salvation to the
cross alone, and that, just as the sun transforms the
earth and causes it to produce fruit, so the light of
the Gospel would transform their hearts and lead
them to perform new works. Others, who were
sarcastic and simply negative men, confined themselves
to pointing out the abuses of Rome and of its
clergy. They said openly what hitherto they had
dared to utter only in secret. If they saw a cordelier
passing, with ruddy face, long beard, brown frock,
and disgusting aspect, they pointed at him and said:
'These monks creep not only into the consciences of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">{514}</a></span>
the citizens, but into their houses, and defile the city
by their scandals and adultery.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_801" id="Ref_801" href="#Foot_801">[801]</a></span>
Our grated windows
and bolted doors can hardly keep out their unbridled
vices, and protect the chastity of our wives and
daughters.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_802" id="Ref_802" href="#Foot_802">[802]</a></span>
God has given them up to the lusts of
their hearts.'</p>

<p>Such conversations as these were continually taking
place among the Genevans and the Bernese during
the interval between the reformation of Berne and
that of Geneva. When a Genevan invited a Switzer
to his house, the former would volunteer, after dinner,
to show his guest the curiosities of the city. 'We
will first go and have a look at the church of St.
Pierre,' said he. 'See what a fine cathedral it is;
admire these pillars, these arches, that vaulted roof;
but there are other things besides. Here is a shrine
containing an invaluable treasure—the arm of St.
Anthony.... On holidays it is brought out for the
adoration of the people, who kiss the relic with holy
reverence. But,' added the Genevan, in a whisper
to his companion, 'this arm some people affirm to be
only one of the members of a stag. Come with me to
the high altar; you see the box in which the brains of
St. Peter are preserved!... To doubt this is a frightful
heresy, and not to adore them abominable impiety;
but ... between you and me ... these brains of the
apostle are only pumice-stone.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_803" id="Ref_803" href="#Foot_803">[803]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=MONKISH TRICKS.=</p>

<p>Sometimes Swiss and Genevans crossed the river
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">{515}</a></span>
and climbed the street leading to the ancient church
of St. Gervais. 'What are those old women about,
putting their ears to that hole?' asked one of them.
A number of priests and women had collected there.
'The bodies of St. Gervais, St. Nazaire, St. Celsus,
and St. Pantaleon are buried under this altar,' said
the priests to the women. 'These holy bodies desire
to quit their vault; come and listen at this hole, and
you will hear them.' The simple women approached,
and heard a noise like that of men talking together.
'We can hear them,' they said.—'Alas!' continued
the priests, 'in order to raise the body of a saint, we
require bishops, ceremonies, silver utensils, and we
have nothing!' As they wished to deliver these holy
personages, these good women immediately cast their
offerings into the church box ... and the priests
gathered them up. 'Do you know,' said a huguenot,
'incredulous people affirm that the noise which proceeds,
as the priests say, from the conversation of
St. Pantaleon and his friends, is caused by certain
pipes, cleverly arranged, which, immediately the hole
is opened and the air flows in, give out the sounds
that are heard?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_804" id="Ref_804" href="#Foot_804">[804]</a></span></p>

<p>'Have you ever seen souls out of purgatory?
Nothing is easier at Geneva,' said a huguenot after
supper. 'It is quite dark; let us go to the cemetery,
and I will show them to you.... Here we are.... Do
you see those little flames creeping slowly here and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">{516}</a></span>
there among the scattered bones?... They are souls
(the priests tell us) which, having left their place of
anguish, crawl slowly about the cemetery at night,
and entreat their relatives to pay the priests for
masses and prayers to free them from purgatorial
fires.... Wait a little ... there is one coming near
us ... I will deliver it.' He stooped, and, picking
it up, showed it to his companions: 'Ha! ha! upon
my word, these souls are curiously made ... they
are crabs, and the priests have fastened little wax
tapers to their backs.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_805" id="Ref_805" href="#Foot_805">[805]</a></span></p>

<p>'That is one of the tricks of our clergy,' said a
learned huguenot. (Bonivard often took part in these
conversations.) 'They are buffoons in their repasts,
fools in all difficult discussions, snails in work, harpies
in exaction, leopards in friendship, bulls in pride,
minotaurs in devouring, and foxes in cunning.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_806" id="Ref_806" href="#Foot_806">[806]</a></span></p>

<p>The Genevans went further still. One day—it was
Tuesday, the 4th of January, 1530—when several
huguenots had met together, and the relics and
impositions of the priests had formed the subject of
conversation, some of them, living in St. Gervais,
indignant at the frauds of the clergy, who metamorphosed
the bodies of saints into mines of gold,
determined to protest against these abuses. They
went out of the house in a body, marched up and down
the different streets, and, stopping at certain places,
assembled the people in the usual manner, when, surrounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">{517}</a></span>
by a large crowd, they held (says the council
register) 'an auction of an unusual sort, by way of
derision.' Perhaps they offered the bodies to the
highest bidder; but, in any case, they themselves were
sent to prison.</p>

<p>This scene had greatly amused the inhabitants of
the suburb. Old superstitions were giving way in
Geneva and falling to the ground amid the applause
of the people. The huguenots claimed the right of
free inquiry, and desired that the human understanding
should have some authority in the world. These
experiments of liberty, which alarmed the Church,
delighted the citizens. The inhabitants of St. Gervais,
animated with generous sentiments, went in great
numbers to the hôtel-de-ville. 'We desire that the
prisoners be set at liberty,' said they to the syndics,
'and we offer to be bail for them.' The magistrates
still clung to the old order of things.—'I ought to
reprimand you severely for your disorders,' said the
premier syndic. 'We will have no tumult or sedition
here. Let the relatives of the prisoners come before
the council to-morrow, and we will hear them.' On
the 9th of January, the Two-Hundred resolved to
pardon the prisoners, and to tell them that this folly,
if they ever committed another like it, should count
double against them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_807" id="Ref_807" href="#Foot_807">[807]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=A NEGATIVE REFORM.=</p>

<p>The beginning of the Reformation at Geneva had a
negative character. Men everywhere in the sixteenth
century felt the need of thinking and judging....
The Genevans, more than others, wished to reform
the abuses which successive usurpations had introduced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">{518}</a></span>
into the State: how could they fail to demand
a reform of the abuses introduced into the Church?
Not only isolated grievances and local annoyances,
but popery itself, would be struck down by a reform.
This course, natural as it seemed, was not the best,
however. The external, that is to say, government,
rites, and ceremonies, are not essentials in christianity;
but the internal, namely, faith in the teaching of the
Word of God, change of heart, and a new life—these
are essential. When we wish to reform a vicious man,
it is not enough to take off his filthy clothes and
wash the dirt from his face: his will must be transformed.
At Wittemberg the Reformation began in
the person of Luther with the internal; at Geneva it
began in the huguenots with the external. This
would have been a great disadvantage, if religion at
Geneva had not become, under the influence of Calvin,
as internal as in Germany. The Genevese reform
would have perished if it had preserved the character
it assumed at first. But the tendency we have
pointed out was a useful preparation for that change
which realises the grand announcement of Christ:
'<i>The kingdom of God is within you</i>.'</p>

<p>The bishop, who was still in Burgundy, desired
neither internal nor external reform. He was alarmed
at what was taking place at Geneva, and, finding
himself unable alone to check the torrent which
threatened to sweep away both mitre and principality,
he complained to the duke, the emperor, and
even the syndics. On the 8th of August, a messenger
from the prelate appeared before the council, and
ordered them, in his name, 'to desist from what they
had begun, and to send ambassadors to Charles V., who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">{519}</a></span>
would put everything to rights.' In October, the
bishop, annoyed that they paid no attention to his
complaints, made fresh demands, in a severe and
threatening tone. He gave them to understand that
he would destroy Geneva rather than permit any
abuses to be reformed. His letters were read in the
council, and their contents communicated to the
people. Threatened with the anger of the duke, the
pope, and the emperor, and reduced to the greatest
weakness, what would they do? 'Geneva,' they said,
'is in danger of being destroyed.... But God watches
over us.... Better have war and liberty than peace
and servitude. We do not put our trust in princes,
and to God alone be the honour and glory.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_808" id="Ref_808" href="#Foot_808">[808]</a></span>
With such confidence nations never perish.</p>

<p class="side">=THE GENEVANS TRUST IN GOD.=</p>

<p>Geneva required it much. Her enemies said that
violent revolutions were at the gate; that they had
begun in Saxony, where at least they had not touched
the political authority; while, on the contrary, in this
city of the Alps, civil revolution was advancing side by
side with religious revolution. The Swiss were beginning
to be tired of a city so weak and yet so obstinate,
which had not strength to defend itself and too much
pride to submit. Excited and influenced by the
Duke of Savoy, they determined to propose a revocation
of the alliance. This news spread consternation
through the city. 'Alas!' said the huguenots, 'if the
sheep give up the dogs, the wolves will soon scatter
them;' and, without waiting to receive notice of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">{520}</a></span>
fatal determination, the patriots stretched out their
hands towards that Switzerland from which the duke
wished to separate them, and exclaimed: 'We will
die sooner!'... But, at the same time, the few
mamelukes who still remained in the city, thinking
that the end was at hand, made haste to join the ducal
army.</p>

<p>The end seemed to be really approaching. On the
1st of May, an imposing embassy from the five cantons
of Zurich, Basle, Soleure, Berne, and Friburg, arrived
at Geneva, and was soon followed by delegates from
Savoy. The Genevans saw with astonishment the
Swiss and the Savoyards walking together in the
streets, lavishing marks of courtesy on each other, and
looking at the huguenots with a haughty air. What!
the descendants of William Tell shaking hands with
their oppressors! The thoughts of the citizens became
confused: they asked each other if there could be
any fellowship between liberty and despotism.... They
were forced to drain the cup to the dregs. On the
22nd of May the embassy appeared before the council.
Their spokesman was Sebastian de Diesbach, a haughty
Bernese, eminent magistrate, distinguished diplomatist,
and celebrated soldier. He refused to call the
Genevans his co-burghers, bluntly demanded the
revocation of the alliance, and proposed a peace which
would have sacrificed the independence of the citizens
to the duke. At the same time he gave them to know
that the Swiss were not singular in their opinion,
and that the great powers of Europe were making a
general arrangement. In truth, Francis I., changing
his policy, supported the demands of his uncle the
duke, and declared that, in case of refusal, he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">{521}</a></span>
unite the armies of France with those of Savoy.
Charles V. was quite ready to repay himself for his
inability to destroy the protestants of Germany, by
indulging in the pleasure of crushing this haughty
little city. Even the King of Hungary sent an ambassador
to Geneva in the Savoy interest. Would
this little corner of the world presume to remain
free when Europe was resolved to crush it under its
iron heel?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_809" id="Ref_809" href="#Foot_809">[809]</a></span></p>

<p>While the powerful princes around Geneva were
oscillating between two opinions—so that at times it
was hard to say whether Charles was for the pope or
against him, and whether Francis was for the protestants
or against them—the Genevans, those men
of iron, had but one idea, liberty ... liberty both in
State and Church. The huguenots showed themselves
determined, and kept a bold front in the presence
of the ambassadors. 'Take care, gentlemen,' said De
Lussey, De Mezere, and others; 'we shall first exercise
strict justice against the city, and, if that is not sufficient,
strict war; while, if you restore to the duke his
old privileges, he will forgive everything, and guarantee
your liberties.'—'Yes,' added the Swiss, 'under
a penalty of ten thousand crowns if he does the
contrary.' ... But, 'marvellous sight,' says a contemporary,
'the more the ambassadors threatened and
frightened, the more the Genevans stood firm and
constant, and exclaimed: "We will die sooner!"'</p>

<p class="side">=SWISS PROPOSE TO BREAK THE ALLIANCE.=</p>

<p>On the 23rd of May the Sire de Diesbach proposed
the revocation of the alliance to the Council of Two
Hundred; and on the following day, the council-general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">{522}</a></span>
having been summoned, the premier syndic,
without losing time in endless explanations, plainly
answered the deputies of the cantons: 'Most honoured
lords, as the alliance with the League was not concluded
hastily (<i>à la chaude</i>), we hope in God and in
the oath you made to us that it will never be broken.
As for us, we are determined to keep ours.' The
magistrate then turned towards the people and said:
'I propose that whosoever speaks of annulling the
alliance with the Swiss shall have his head cut off
without mercy, and that whosoever gets information
of any intrigue going on against the alliance, and does
not reveal it, shall receive the strappado thrice.' The
general council carried this resolution unanimously.</p>

<p>Diesbach and his colleagues were confounded, and
looked at one another with astonishment. 'Did not
Monsieur of Savoy assure us,' they said, 'that, except
some twenty-five or thirty citizens, all the people were
favourable to him?'—'And I too know,' said a
stranger, whose name has not been handed down to
us, 'that if the alliance had been broken, the duke
would have entered Geneva and put thirty-two citizens
to death.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_810" id="Ref_810" href="#Foot_810">[810]</a></span>
'Come with us,' said the most respected
men in Geneva; and, laying their charters
before the ambassadors, they proved by these documents
that they were free to contract an alliance with
the cantons. The delegates from Berne, Friburg,
Zurich, Basle, and Soleure ordered their horses to be
got ready. Some huguenots assembled in the street,
and shouted out, just as the Bernese lords were getting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">{523}</a></span>
into their saddles: 'We would sooner destroy the city,
sooner sacrifice our wives, our children, and ourselves,
than consent to revoke the alliance.' When Diesbach
made a report of his mission at Berne, he found means
to gloss over his defeat a little: 'There were a thousand
people at the general council,' he said with some
exaggeration; 'only <i>one</i> person [he meant the president]
protested against the rupture of the alliance;
upon which <i>all the rest joined in with him</i>!'... Did
he not know that it was quite regular for a proposition
to be made by <i>one</i> person, and to be carried by a
whole nation?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_811" id="Ref_811" href="#Foot_811">[811]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=FIRMNESS OF THE GENEVANS.=</p>

<p>A new spirit, unknown to their ancestors, now
began to animate many of the Genevans. Ab Hofen's
mission had not been without effect. Besides a goodly
number of persons, who were called indeed 'by the
name of Luther,' but whose sole idea of reform was not
to fast in Lent and not to cross themselves during divine
worship, there were others who desired to receive the
Word of God and to follow it. The Romish clergy
understood this well. 'If these Genevans cling so
much to the Swiss,' said the priests at their meetings,
'it is in order that they may profess <i>heresy</i> freely. If
they succeed, we shall perhaps see Savoy, Aosta, and
other countries of Italy reforming themselves likewise.'</p>

<p>The duke, being determined to extinguish these
threatening flames, resolved to claim the influence of
the pope, with his treasures and even his soldiers; for
the <i>vicar</i> of Him who forbade the sword to be drawn
possesses an army. Besides, Clement VII. was one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">{524}</a></span>
the cleverest politicians of the age, and his advice
might be useful. As Pietro Gazzini, Bishop of Aosta,
was then at Rome, the court of Turin commissioned
that zealous ultramontanist to inform the pope of what
was going on at Geneva. Gazzini begged an audience
of Clement, and having been introduced by the master
of the ceremonies on the 11th of July, 1529, he
approached the pope, who was seated on the throne,
and, kneeling down, kissed his feet. When he arose,
he described all the acts committed by the Lutherans
at Geneva and in the <i>valleys of Savoy</i>. 'O holy
father,' said he, 'the dangers of the Church are imminent,
and we are filled with the liveliest fears. It is
from Upper Burgundy and the country of Neufchatel
that this accursed sect has come to Geneva. And
now, alas! what mischief it has done there!...
Already the bishop dares not remain in his diocese;
already Lent is abolished, and the heretics eat meat
every day; and, worse still, they read forbidden books
(the New Testament), and the Genevans set such
store by them that they refuse to give them up, even
for money. These miserable heretics are doing extreme
mischief, and not at Geneva only; Aosta and
Savoy would have been perverted long since, had not
his highness beheaded twelve gentlemen who were
propagating these dangerous doctrines. But this
wholesome severity is not enough to stop the evil.
Although his highness has forbidden, under pain of
death, any one to speak of this sect and its abominable
dogmas, there is no lack of <i>wicked babblers</i> who go
about circulating these accursed doctrines all over his
territories. They say that his highness is not their
king; and, making a pretence of the great expenses of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">{525}</a></span>
the war, they vehemently call upon us to sell the
little ecclesiastical property we possess.... The duke,
my lord and master, is everywhere destroying this
sect. <i>He is the barrier that closes Italy against it</i>, and
in this way he renders your holiness the most signal
service; but we need your help.' Gazzini closed his
address with a demand for a subsidy.</p>

<p class="side">=BISHOP OF AOSTA AND THE POPE.=</p>

<p>Clement had listened with great attention; he
understood the mischief and the danger which the
Bishop of Aosta had pointed out, and the dignitaries
and other priests around him seemed still more
affected. Thoroughly versed in philosophical and
theological questions, endowed with a perspicacity that
penetrated to the very heart of the most difficult
matters, the pope saw how great the danger would be
if <i>heresy</i> should find in the south, at Geneva, a centre
that might become far more <i>pernicious</i> than even
Wittemberg; he felt also the necessity of having a
prince, a zealous catholic, to guard the French and
Italian slopes of the Alps. This pontiff, perhaps the
most unlucky of all the popes, saw the Reformation
spreading under his eyes over Europe without having
the power to stop it, and whatever he did to oppose
it served but to propagate it more widely still. Now,
however, he met with a sympathising heart. He wished
to prevent Geneva from being reformed, and to save a
fortress from being delivered up to the enemy; while
a powerful prince offered to carry out the necessary
measures. Clement therefore received Gazzini's overtures
very graciously; and yet he was ill at ease. In
the Piedmontese ambassador's speech there was a
word, one word only, that embarrassed him—the subsidy:
in fact, he had not recovered from the sack of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">{526}</a></span>
Rome. Clement VII. replied: 'I look upon his
highness as my dearest son, and I thank him for his
zeal; but as for money, it is impossible for me to give
him any, considering the emptiness of the treasury.'
Then, appealing to the wants of the Church and the
duty of princes, who ought to be ready to sacrifice for
it their wealth, their subjects, and their lives, the pope
added: '<i>I pray the duke to keep his eye particularly
upon Geneva. That city is becoming far too Lutheran,
and it must be put down at any risk.</i>'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_812" id="Ref_812" href="#Foot_812">[812]</a></span>
Gazzini, having
been attended to the gates of the palace by the
pontifical officers, regretted his failure in the matter
of the subsidy. His chief object, however, had been
attained: the papacy was warned; it would watch
Geneva as a general watches the enemy.</p>

<p class="side">=INTERFERENCE OF THE EMPEROR.=</p>

<p>As the pope was won, it next became necessary to
influence the emperor. That was an easier task for
the duke, as Charles V. was his brother-in-law, and
the empress and the Duchess of Savoy, who were
sisters, and strongly attached to Rome, could write
to each other on the subject. The protest drawn up
at Spires by the evangelical princes, in April 1529,
had irritated that monarch exceedingly; and he
therefore prepared, in accordance with the oath he
had sworn at Barcelona, to apply 'a suitable antidote
against the pestilent malady under which christendom
was suffering.' When Geneva was mentioned to him,
his first thought was that it was a long way off; yet,
as it was an imperial city, he determined to include
it in the plan of his campaign, and resolved immediately
to take a preliminary step to restore it to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">{527}</a></span>
papacy. On the 16th of July, 1529, the emperor
dictated to his secretary the following letter, addressed
to the syndics of Geneva:—</p>

<div class="top">
<div class="left1">'<span class="smc">Faithful Friends</span>,</div>
</div>

<p style="text-indent:2em">'We have been informed that several preachers
hold private and public meetings in your city and in
the frontier countries, that they propagate the errors
of Luther, and that you tolerate these proceedings.
These practices cause the Church most serious damage,
and the pontifical majesty, as well as the imperial
dignity, is grievously insulted by your conduct.
Wherefore we order you to arrest the said preachers,
and punish them according to the tenor of the severest
edicts. By this means you will extirpate impiety
from your country, and will do an act agreeable to
God and conformable to our express will.</p>

<div class="foot">
<div class="right1">'<span class="smc">Carolus</span>, Imp.'<span
                    class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_813" id="Ref_813"
                    href="#Foot_813">[813]</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>This letter, which savoured so strongly of the
absolute monarch, excited much astonishment in
Geneva. The citizens did not deny that the emperor
might claim a certain authority over them, since
theirs was an imperial city. They have resisted the
bishop-prince, they have resisted the duke: will they
also resist this powerful sovereign? His demand was
clear, and some of them said that to oppose so great a
prince would be the height of madness, in a little city
of merchants. But the Genevans did not hesitate,
and, without any bravado, returned the emperor this
simple message: 'Sire, we intend to live, as in past
times, according to God and the law of Jesus Christ.'</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">{528}</a></div>

<p>Upon this, Charles promised to assist the duke with
an armed force. The pope, too, changed his mind,
in spite of his refusal to Gazzini, and found <i>in the
emptiness of his treasury</i> a subsidy of four thousand
Spanish livres. The two mightiest personages in
christendom united against this little city their influence,
their excommunications, their cunning, their
wealth, and their soldiers; and everything was got
ready for the meditated attack.</p>

<p class="side">=THE FISCAL'S COMPLAINTS.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE courage of the defenders of catholicism in
Geneva was revived by the news they received
from without; and the emperor, the pope, and the
duke declaring themselves ready to do their duty, the
episcopal officers prepared to do theirs also. But one
circumstance might paralyse all their efforts: 'God,
of his goodness, began at this time,' says a manuscript,
'to implant a knowledge of the truth, of his holy
Gospel, and of the Reformation in the hearts of some
individuals in Geneva, by the intercourse they had with
the people of Berne.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_814" id="Ref_814" href="#Foot_814">[814]</a></span>
These huguenots boldly professed
the protestant ideas they had imbibed, and,
though possessing no very enlightened faith, felt a
pleasure in attacking with sarcasm and ridicule the
priests and their followers. Curés and friars waited
every day upon the episcopal vicar, and complained
bitterly of these <i>Lutherans</i>, as they called them, who,
in their own houses, or in the public places, and even
in the churches, as they walked up and down the aisles,
spoke aloud of the necessity of a reformation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_815" id="Ref_815" href="#Foot_815">[815]</a></span>
On
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">{530}</a></span>
the 22nd of March, the vicar, eager to do his duty
in the absence of the bishop, sent for the procurator-fiscal,
and consulted with him on the defence of the
faith. The procurator appeared before the council.
'Heresy is boldly raising its head,' he said; 'the
people eat meat in Lent, according to the practice of
the Lutheran sect. Instead of devoutly listening to
the mass, they promenade (<i>passagiare</i>) the church
during divine service.... If we do not put a stop to
this evil, the city will be ruined.... I command you,
in behalf of my lord the bishop, to punish these rebels
severely.' The Berne manuscript adds, 'He made
great complaints, accompanied with reproaches and
threats.' The Duke of Savoy supported him by advising
the council to take precautions against the
Lutheran errors that were making their way into
the city. The magistrates were fully inclined to
check religious innovation: 'We must compel everybody,'
they said, 'to listen to the mass with respect.'
The huguenots pointed out the danger of
attending in any degree to the duke's wishes, for in
that case he would fancy himself the sovereign of
Geneva. What was to be done? A man of some
wit proposed a singular and hitherto unheard-of
penalty for suppressing heresy, which was adopted
and published in spite of the opposition of the most
determined huguenots: 'Ordered, that whoever eats
meat in Lent, or walks about the churches, shall be
condemned to build <i>three toises of the wall</i> of St.
Gervais.' The city was building this wall as a means
of defence against the duke.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_816" id="Ref_816" href="#Foot_816">[816]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE HUGUENOTS SENTENCED.=</p>

<p>This decree raised a storm against the Roman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">{531}</a></span>
clergy. There have been at all times estimable men
among the catholic priests, and even christians who,
with great self-sacrifice, have dedicated themselves to
the alleviation of human misery. The party spirit
that represents a whole class of men as hypocrites,
fanatics, and debauchees, is opposed to justice as well
as to charity. It must be confessed, however, that
there were not at this time in Geneva many of those
pious and zealous priests who have been found in the
Roman-catholic Church since it was awakened by the
Reformation. 'What!' exclaimed the members of
council who inclined towards protestantism, and saw
their friends condemned, 'the Church forbids us to
eat food which God created for our use, and permits
priests to gratify an insatiable lewdness, against which
God has pronounced a severe condemnation!... Ha!
ha! Messieurs du clergé, you wish us to eat nothing
but fish, and you live in habitual intercourse with
harlots.... Hypocrites! you strain at the gnat and
swallow the camel.' At the same time these citizens
exposed the irregularities of the priests and monks,
pointed out their resorts for debauchery, and described
the scandals occasioned by their lusts. This description,
which every one knew to be true, made a deep
impression. The good catholics who were on the
council saw the injury done to religion by the immorality
of the clergy; while certain practical men
were inclined to consider the great movement then
going on in the Church as essentially a reform of
morals. 'The Lutheran sect increases and prospers,'
said a catholic councillor, 'because of the scandal of
the priests, who live openly with women of evil life.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_817" id="Ref_817" href="#Foot_817">[817]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">{532}</a></div>

<p class="side">=PRIESTS SENTENCED.=</p>

<p>The council sent for the vicar-general: 'We have a
great complaint to make,' they told him. 'No remedy
has been applied to the depravity and scandalous conduct
of the ecclesiastics, who are the cause of all kinds
of irregularity. Exert your authority without waiting
until the secular power is compelled to interfere.'
It would appear that, as the vicar held out no great
hopes of amendment, the council were of opinion that,
after condemning the laymen who walked about in the
churches, they ought also to condemn the priests who
were caught in disorderly houses. One councillor
imagined it would be but fair to yoke, so to say, these
two different kinds of delinquents to the same car. A
second resolution was therefore adopted by the council,
which, never losing sight of the necessity of protecting
the city against Savoy, ordered 'that the priests
should forthwith forsake their evil ways under penalty
of building three toises of the wall of St. Gervais, in
company with the others.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_818" id="Ref_818" href="#Foot_818">[818]</a></span>
Thus the forerunners of
protestantism and the profligate priests were ordered
to labour together at the same task in the fosses of
St. Gervais. The latter were indignant at being placed
in the same rank with the former, and thought their
dignity compromised by the singular decree which
forced them to supply the heretics with mortar. It
would appear, however, that the two orders were not
very strictly observed, that wicked ecclesiastics continued
to gratify their appetites, and that the wall
advanced but slowly. 'The canons, priests, and friars
are incorrigible,' said the people; 'they are jovial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">{533}</a></span>
fellows, fond of drinking, and rear their bastard children
openly. How can the Church be scandalised at
such a course of life, when even the popes set the
example?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_819" id="Ref_819" href="#Foot_819">[819]</a></span></p>

<p>Although this decree of the council showed great
impartiality and a certain amount of good sense, we
cannot put in the same rank the two classes whom it
affected. The huguenots, seeing that the Holy Scriptures
call that a <i>doctrine of devils</i> which commands men
'<i>to abstain from meats which God hath created to be
received with thanksgiving</i>,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_820" id="Ref_820" href="#Foot_820">[820]</a></span>
did what the Word of
God directs, while the evil priests indulged in the most
scandalous disorders. Negative protestantism, however,
is not true piety; and hence it was that the
evangelical christians of Zurich and Berne, taking
advantage of the frequent journeys the Genevans made
to these two cities on public or private business, were
constantly urging them to receive the true essence of
the Gospel. In the visits they made to each other, in
their friendly walks on the shore of the lake of Zurich
or on the hills which overlook the Aar, these pious
reformers of German Switzerland said to the huguenots:
'<i>The kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but
righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_821" id="Ref_821" href="#Foot_821">[821]</a></span>
Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, but born as a
man, has become our Redeemer by his death and by
his resurrection. He alone satisfies completely the
religious wants of mankind. Unite yourselves to Him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">{534}</a></span>
by faith, and you will experience in yourselves that
the pure religion of the Gospel is not only the first
among all religions professed by men, but, as coming
from God, is perfect.'</p>

<p class="side">=PLAN FOR PREACHING AT ST. VICTOR.=</p>

<p>The four Vandels, without entirely breaking with
Rome, had been for more than three years among the
most decided of the so-called Lutheran party. Hugues
Vandel was sent into Switzerland as ambassador (this
is the name usually given to the envoys in the official
documents of the period). At Zurich, 'the Zwinglians
gave him a hearty welcome;' the friends of Haller did
the same at Berne, where he happened to be in June
1530. All of the evangelicals in these two cities
were earnest in their wishes to see a vital christianity
displace the few negative reforms in Geneva. 'The
majority in the city of Geneva would like to be evangelical,'
answered Vandel; 'but they want to be shown
the way, and no one would dare preach the Gospel in
the churches for fear of Friburg.' What is to be done?
thought he. Day and night he tried to find the means
of having the Gospel preached to his fellow-citizens;
at last a bright idea suddenly occurred to him; he
spoke about it to the Zwinglians at Zurich, and to
Berthold Haller at Berne; he wrote about it to Farel,
to Christopher Fabry, and also to his brother Robert
at Geneva. His idea was this: It will be remembered
that St. Victor was a little independent principality at
the gates of the city. 'Suppose it were made over to
my lords of Berne,' said Vandel; 'they would like to
have a bailiff there and <i>a preacher who would be our
great comfort</i>.' It is true that the church of St. Victor
was old, and would probably 'tumble down' erelong,
but Berne would be able to rebuild it. All the evangelicals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">{535}</a></span>
of Geneva, forsaking the mass in the city churches,
and crossing St. Antoine, would go in crowds to hear
Christ preached in the church of Bonivard.... Thus
that Renaissance of which the prior was the representative,
would be truly for Geneva the gate of the Reformation.
An event which had just taken place may
have suggested this idea to Vandel. It was a scheme
suggested by the pope, and carried out by the duke.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_822" id="Ref_822" href="#Foot_822">[822]</a></span></p>

<p>Bonivard, deprived of his benefice at the time of
Berthelier's death, had recovered his priory but not his
revenue. Endowed, as he was, with resolution and
invention rather than perseverance, holding that the
detention of his property by the duke was an injustice,
desiring to be restored to full possession of his little
principality, and not a little ashamed of having to
tell his servant that he had nothing in his purse when
the latter came and asked for money to purchase the
necessaries of life—Bonivard had girded on his sword,
taken a musquetoon, mounted his horse, and, thus
equipped and accompanied by a few men-at-arms, had
made several raids into the duke's territory to levy his
rents. But he had to deal both with the duke and
the pope. He had been replaced in his priory by
the bishop and the council, but without the consent
of the courts of Rome and Turin, which had illegally despoiled
him of it. Consequently a pontifical proctor,
attended by an escort, made his appearance to prevent
the prior from recovering his property. Bonivard, who
was naturally impetuous, looked upon this man as a
robber come to plunder him; he therefore rushed forward,
caught up his arms, and discharged his musquetoon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">{536}</a></span>
at the Roman official. The latter, who was terrified,
rode off as fast as he could; for Bonivard with his firelock
had wounded the horse.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_823" id="Ref_823" href="#Foot_823">[823]</a></span>
Both pope and duke
were loud in their complaints, and Clement even issued
a brief against him. In consequence of this, the council
of Geneva forbade Bonivard to indulge in these military
freaks; and as he had no means of living, the
magistrates granted him four crowns and a half a
month, to pay his expenses and those of his servant,
until he was in a better position. 'Alas!' said the
prior, 'four crowns a month! ... it is so little, that I
can hardly keep myself and my page.' However, he
remained patient, but he was not left in peace.</p>

<p>The Roman proctor, taking up the matter again,
claimed the priory, in the name of Clement, on behalf
of the priest who had been invested with it after the
death of the traitor Montheron. Bonivard, desiring
to place his benefice beyond the reach of fresh attacks,
annexed it to the hospital of Geneva, which was to receive
the revenues for him as prior. But the duke had
other views. More than four hundred persons, carrying
arms, and assembling by night before the hôtel-de-ville,
had demanded justice on certain monks of St.
Victor, who were accused of plotting to betray the
convent to the partisans of Savoy. Besançon Hugues
and Thomas Vandel, the procurator-fiscal, were the
bearers of this request, and Bonivard had the monks
shut up in prison. When the duke was informed of
the annexation of the priory to the hospital of Geneva,
his anger was increased, for he had a great desire to
possess St. Victor's, which would give him a footing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">{537}</a></span>
close to the gates of the city. His agents therefore
solicited the prior 'daily' to revoke this act, and promised
him 'seas and mountains' if he would consent;
but Bonivard shook his head, saying: 'I do not trust
him!' Charles now determined to get rid of a man
who was an obstacle in his path in all his enterprises
against Geneva.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_824" id="Ref_824" href="#Foot_824">[824]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=BONIVARD'S FILIAL AFFECTION.=</p>

<p>The prior, usually so cheerful, had been for some
time dejected and thoughtful. It was not only his
priory, his poverty, and his enemies that threw a
shade over his countenance, formerly so animated:
his mother was seriously ill. To Bonivard filial piety
was the most natural of obligations, the first and
sweetest form of gratitude. He thought: 'How
correctly Plato writes that there are no Penates
more sacred, there is no worship more acceptable to
the gods, than that of a father or mother bending under
the weight of years.' His Genevese friends, who went
daily to St. Victor's, observed his sadness, and asked
him the reason. 'Alas!' he said, 'I should like to see
my aged mother once more before she dies. I have
not seen her these five years, and she is on the brink of
the grave.' To one of them who inquired where she
was, he replied: 'At Seyssel, in our ancestral house.'
Seyssel was in the states of Savoy, and Charles would
not fail to have the prior seized if he ventured to
appear there.</p>

<p>Bonivard fancied, however, he could see the means
of gratifying his dearest wishes. He determined
to take advantage of the solicitations addressed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">{538}</a></span>
him by Charles to ask for a safe-conduct. 'I will go
and see my mother and brother at Seyssel,' he said,
'and ask their advice. We will consult together
on this business.' The duke sent Bonivard the required
passport, stipulating, however, that it should
be available for the month of April only. Charles,
delighted at seeing Bonivard quit the neighbourhood
of Geneva and venture into the middle of his territories,
determined that if this journey did not give him
the priory, it should at least give him the prior.... Bonivard's
friends, whose judgment was not influenced
by filial affection, were justly alarmed when they
heard of his approaching departure, and tried to detain
him; he could think of nothing, however, but seeing
his mother before she died. He accordingly departed,
passed the Fort de l'Ecluse, the Perte du Rhone, and
reached the little town where the 'ancient dame,' as
he called her, resided. The mother, who loved the
name, the talents, the glory, and the person of her
son, clasped him in her arms with fond affection; but
her joy soon gave way to fear, for she knew Charles's
perfidy, she remembered Lévrier's story ... and trembled
for her child.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_825" id="Ref_825" href="#Foot_825">[825]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=BONIVARD'S VISIT TO HIS MOTHER.=</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bonivard's enemies in Geneva had not
delayed to take advantage of his departure. Some of
them were mamelukes. To embroil him with the
huguenots seemed likely to be of service to their cause;
and they therefore began to report in the city that he
had gone to surrender St. Victor's to the duke, and that
he was betraying the people and revealing their secrets.
The intimate friends of the prior indignantly contradicted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">{539}</a></span>
the calumny; but his enemies continued repeating
it, and, as the most ardent men are often
the most credulous, a few huguenots gave credit to
these assertions. Bonivard wrote to the council of
Geneva, complaining of the injury done him, and reminded
them that there was not a man in the city
more devoted to its independence than himself.</p>

<p>What should he do? He was exceedingly embarrassed.
Should he return to Geneva? He feared the
anger of those among the huguenots in whose eyes it
was a crime to go to Savoy. Should he remain at
Seyssel? As soon as the month of April was ended,
he would be seized by the duke. His mother conjured
him to put himself out of the reach of his enemies,
both duke and Genevans....</p>

  <p class="center small">'Et qui refuserait une mère qui prie?...</p>

<p>He determined to go to Friburg. The council of
Geneva had indeed told him not to disquiet himself
about the foolish stories of his enemies, and added:
'Let him come, if he pleases, and he will be treated
well.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_826" id="Ref_826" href="#Foot_826">[826]</a></span>
This was not a very pressing invitation, and
Besançon Hugues, the most influential man in the
city, was against him. Hugues, a catholic and episcopalian,
might very well have no great liking for the
prior of a monastery who was coming round entirely
to the new ideas. It seems, however, that these catholic
prejudices were mixed up with some human weaknesses.
'Bonivard,' says a manuscript, 'often had
disputes with Besançon Hugues, who hoped to obtain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">{540}</a></span>
for his son the investiture of the priory of St. Victor.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_827" id="Ref_827" href="#Foot_827">[827]</a></span>
The prior was not ignorant of this hostile disposition.
'Alas!' he said, 'a councillor, and he not one of the
least, is exciting the council and the people against
me.' On the other hand, he could not make up his
mind to turn thoroughly to the side of the Reformation;
he still remained in the neutral ground of
Erasmus, and indulged in jests against the huguenots,
which indisposed them towards him. He belonged
neither to one party nor to the other, and offended
both. He was not anxious, therefore, to return to
Geneva just now, fearing that his enemies would be
stronger than his friends. The month of April being
ended, he begged the duke to prolong his safe-conduct
during the month of May, and it was granted. Bonivard
now took leave of his aged mother, whom he left
full of anguish about the fate of her son. She never
saw him again.</p>

<p>The Count of Chalans, president of the council of
Savoy, and friend of the Bishop of Aosta, was, though
a layman, as bigoted to Roman-catholicism as Gazzini
was, as a priest. At that time he was holding a
<i>journée</i> or diet at Romont, between Lausanne and
Friburg. The avoyer of Friburg, who was Bonivard's
friend, happening to be at Romont, Bonivard repaired
thither; and, related as he was to the nobility of Savoy,
he presented his homage to the count, who received
him kindly. Bonivard skilfully sounded De Chalans
on what he might have to fear; for once already, and
not far from that place, he had been seized and thrown
into a ducal prison. The count pledged his honour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">{541}</a></span>
both verbally and in writing, that he would run no
danger in the duke's territories during the month of
May, and, he added, even during the month of June.
Bonivard, thus set at ease, began to reflect on his position.
It was a strange thing for a man, so enlightened
as he was on the abuses of popery and monasticism,
to be at the head of a monastic body. Moreover,
in addition to the pope and the duke, he had a new
adversary against him. 'I fear the duke on the one
hand,' he said, 'and on the other the madness of the
people of Geneva, to whom I dare not return without
the strongest pledges.'</p>

<p class="side">=DETERMINES TO GIVE UP THE PRIORY.=</p>

<p>Bonivard, having weighed everything, determined
upon a great sacrifice. He started for Lausanne, and
proposed to the Bishop of Montfaucon to resign to him
the priory of St. Victor, on condition of receiving a
pension of four hundred crowns. The bishop accepted
the proposal, provided Geneva and Savoy would
consent. Bonivard thought this an easy matter, and
as René de Chalans was then holding another <i>journée</i>
at Moudon, he determined to go thither to arrange the
great affair. He arrived on the 25th of May. The
count received him courteously, and appeared to enter
into his ideas; but at the same time this lord and certain
officers of Savoy held several private conferences,
the result of which was that they sent a messenger
to Lausanne. Bonivard was invited to sup with the
president, who gave him the seat of honour. There
was a large party, the repast was very animated, and
the prior, whose gaiety was easily revived, amused all
the company by his wit. There was, however, one
officer at his highness's table who annoyed him considerably:
it was the Sire de Bellegarde, Lévrier's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">{542}</a></span>
murderer. This wretch, as if he desired to efface that
disagreeable impression, was most obliging and attentive.
At last they left the table. There were so many
gentlemen assembled in the little town of Moudon,
that all the bed-rooms were occupied—so at least it
was stated. Upon this, Bellegarde, in a jovial tone,
said to Bonivard: 'Well, then, my friend, I will share
my room with you.' Bonivard accepted the offer, but
not without some uneasiness. The next morning he
prepared to set out for Lausanne in order to arrange
his business with the bishop. 'I am afraid that you
will lose your way, and that something may happen to
you,' said Bellegarde. 'I will send a servant on horseback
along with you.' The confiding Bonivard departed
with the sergeant of his highness's steward.</p>

<p>Bellegarde varied his treachery. He had kidnapped
Lévrier as he was leaving the cathedral, and had conveyed
him in person to the castle where he was to meet
his death. This time he preferred to keep out of sight,
and for that reason a message had been despatched
to Lausanne. After watching over Bonivard during
the night, lest he should escape, as Hugues had escaped
from Châtelaine, Bellegarde took leave of him, giving
him a very courteous embrace, and strongly recommending
him to the care of the sergeant. The road
from Moudon to Lausanne runs for about five leagues
through the Jorat hills, which at that period were wild
and lonely. Gloomy thoughts sprang up from time
to time to disturb Bonivard. He remembered how
Lévrier had been seized by Bellegarde at the gates of
St. Pierre.... If a similar fate awaited him!... His
confidence soon revived, and he went on.</p>

<p class="side">=BONIVARD TREACHEROUSLY KIDNAPPED.=</p>

<p>It was a fine day in May, this Thursday, the 26th.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">{543}</a></span>
Early in the morning Messire de Beaufort, captain of
Chillon, and the Sire du Rosey, bailli of Thonon,
having received their instructions from Moudon, had
quitted Lausanne, followed by twelve to fifteen well-armed
horsemen. On reaching the heights of the
Jorat, near the convent of St. Catherine, they hid
themselves in a wood of black pines, which still remains;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_828" id="Ref_828" href="#Foot_828">[828]</a></span>
and there both leaders and soldiers waited
silently for the unfortunate Bonivard. He was provided,
indeed, with a safe-conduct from the duke; but
John Huss's had been violated, and why should they
observe that of the prior of St. Victor? 'No faith
ought to be kept with heretics,' had been said at Constance,
and was repeated now at Moudon. Erelong
De Beaufort and Du Rosey heard the tramp of two
horses; they gave a signal to their followers to be
ready, and peered out from among the trees where
they lay hid to see if their victim was really coming.
At last the guide on horseback appeared, then came
Bonivard on his mule; De Bellegarde's servant led
him straight to the appointed place. Just as the unlucky
prior, wavering between confidence and fear, was
passing the spot where Beaufort, Du Rosey, and their
fifteen companions were posted, the latter rushed from
the wood and sprang upon Bonivard. He put his hand
to his sword, and clapped spurs to his mule in order to
escape, calling out to his guide: 'Spur! spur!' But,
instead of galloping forwards, the sergeant turned
suddenly upon the man he should have protected,
caught hold of him, and 'with a knife which he had
ready' cut Bonivard's sword-belt. All this took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">{544}</a></span>
place in the twinkling of an eye. 'Whereupon these
honest people fell upon me,' said the prior when he
told the story in after years, 'and made me prisoner
in the name of Monseigneur.' He made all the resistance
he could; produced his papers, and showed that
they were all in order; but his safe-conduct was of
no avail with the agents of Bellegarde and De
Chalans. Taking some cord from a bag they had
brought with them, they tied Bonivard's arms, and
bound him to his mule, as they had once bound Lévrier,
and in this way passing through Lausanne, near which
the outrage had been committed, they turned to the left.
The prior crossed Vaux, Vevey, Clarens, and Montreux;
but these districts, which are among the most beautiful
in Switzerland, could not for an instant rouse
him from his deep dejection. 'They took me, bound
and pinioned, to Chillon,' he says in his <i>Chronicles</i>,
'and there I remained six long years.... It was my
second passion.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_829" id="Ref_829" href="#Foot_829">[829]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE PRISONER OF CHILLON.=</p>

<p>Nine years before, almost day for day (May 1521),
Luther had also been seized in a wood for the purpose
of being taken to a castle; but he had been carried off
by friends, while <i>the prisoner of Chillon</i> was perfidiously
taken by enemies. Bonivard, a reformer of a negative
and rather philosophical character, was much inferior
to Luther, the positive and evangelical reformer;
but Bonivard's imprisonment far exceeded in severity
that of the Saxon doctor. At first, indeed, the prior
of St. Victor was confined in a room and treated respectfully;
but Charles the Good, after visiting him
and holding some conversation with him, ordered, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">{545}</a></span>
he left the castle, that the prisoner should be treated
harshly. He was transferred to one of those damp
and gloomy dungeons cut out of the rock, which lie
below the level of the lake. It is probable that the
duke gave this cruel order because the prisoner, true
to light and liberty, had refused to bend before him.
Bonivard's seizure was a severe blow to his mother,
to his friends, and even to the magistrates of Geneva,
who, on hearing of it, saw all the duke's perfidy and
the prior's innocence, and restored to him their affection
and esteem. For some time it was uncertain
whether Bonivard was alive or dead; all that people
knew was that he had been seized, in defiance of the
safe-conduct, on the hills above Lausanne. However,
John Lullin and the other envoys of Geneva present
at the <i>journée</i> held at Payerne at Christmas 1530,
being better informed, did all in their power to obtain
the liberation of a man who had done such good service
to liberty; but the agents of Savoy pretended
ignorance of the place of his imprisonment.</p>

<p>A brilliant existence was thus suddenly interrupted.
What humour, what originality, what striking language,
what invention, what witty conversations were
abruptly cut short! Bonivard never recovered from
these six years of the strictest captivity. When he
came out of Chillon he was a different man from
what he was when he entered it. He was like a bird
which, while giving utterance to the sweetest song,
is caught by a gust of wind and beaten to the ground;
ever after it miserably drags its wings, and utters
none but harsh unpleasing sounds. St. Victor wanted
the <i>one thing needful</i>; he was not one of those of whom
it is said: <i>their youth is renewed like the eagle's</i>. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">{546}</a></span>
brightness of the Reformation eclipsed him. The latter
part of his life was as sad as his early part had been
brilliant. It would have been better for his fame had
he been put to death in the castle-yard of Chillon, as
Lévrier had been in that of Bonne.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XI.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">THE ATTACK OF 1530.<br />
 (<span class="smc">August, September, and October.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="side">=ARREST OF THE FISCAL MANDOLLA.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">BONIVARD'S arrest was not an isolated act, but
the first skirmish of a general engagement. The
duke and the bishop were reconciled, and their only
thought was how they could reduce Geneva by force of
arms. A singular resolution for a pastor! Fortunately
for him, the Genevans gave him a pretext calculated
in some measure to justify his warlike cure of souls.</p>

<p>The iniquitous conduct of the Duke of Savoy towards
Bonivard refuted the unjust accusations brought
against him, and the Genevans at once manifested their
sympathy with the unhappy prisoner of Chillon. They
were indignant at the duke's violation of the safe-conduct
that he himself had given. 'You see his bad
faith,' they said. Thinking that when the innocent
were put in prison, it was time to punish the guilty,
they determined to have their revenge.</p>

<p>There was at Geneva a man named Mandolla, a
procurator-fiscal and thorough-going partisan of the
duke and the bishop. 'He was a bastard priest of
evil name and fame,' say the chronicles of the times,
'who indulged in exactions, and in plundering and
arbitrarily imprisoning those who displeased him.' The
vicar-general, Messire de Gingins, abbot of Bonmont,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">{548}</a></span>
an upright and benevolent man, often remonstrated
with him, but Mandolla answered him with insolence.
Nor was this all; for, having the temporal authority
under his jurisdiction, he was continually intriguing
to deliver up Geneva to the duke. The citizens,
irritated at these encroachments on their rights, addressed
several strong remonstrances to the abbot of
Bonmont against the foreign priest who was trying to
rob them of their independence. It was a serious accusation:
Mandolla's conscience told him it was just; he
took the alarm, and, wishing to escape justice, hastily
quitted Geneva, and fled for refuge to the castle of
Peney.</p>

<p>The Genevans now complained louder than ever.
'Remove this thorn from the city,' said they to the
vicar-general. The abbot acknowledged the justice
of their demand, and the council, the guardians of
the rights of the city, came to his assistance; for
they recollected how, at the election of the syndics in
1526, that man had intrigued to carry the list which
contained the name of the infamous Cartelier. Some
armed men were sent to the castle of Peney, where
they seized Mandolla, bound him to a horse, as Lévrier
and Bonivard had been bound, and on the 24th of
June he was brought back to Geneva, surrounded by
guards who led him to prison. A procurator-fiscal
treated like a criminal! it was a thing unprecedented.
The people stopped in the streets as he passed, and
looked at him with astonishment. The unhappy Mandolla's
mind was in a state of great confusion. He
wondered if they would avenge on him the deaths of
Lévrier and Berthelier and the captivity of Bonivard.
He felt that he was guilty, but trusted in his powerful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">{549}</a></span>
protectors. His friends did not, indeed, lose a moment,
but wrote to the bishop, who was at Arbois.</p>

<p class="side">=THE BISHOP PLOTS AGAINST GENEVA.=</p>

<p>Mandolla had hardly been three days in prison,
when 'a severe and threatening letter' from the
bishop arrived at Geneva. The prelate was indignant
that the citizens should dare lay hands upon a clerk,
who was one of his officers, and especially on that
fiscal who, as Bonivard says, <i>brought the water to his
mill</i>. 'Not content with the unseasonable innovations
you have made in our jurisdiction,' he wrote to the
syndics on the 27th of June, 'you have caused our
procurator to be arrested in the discharge of his functions....
And you do not like to be called traitors!...
We condemn the outrage as much as if you had done
it to our own person. Set our fiscal at liberty, without
any damage to his person; make amends for the
outrage you have committed; otherwise we shall employ
all the means God has placed in our hands to
obtain vengeance.' The council were greatly astonished
on reading this letter: 'The bishop forgets,' they said,
'that this is a case simply of robbery and treason.
How long has it been the custom to threaten with the
vengeance of God and man the magistrates who prosecute
a thief?'—'My lord,' answered the magistrates,
'Mandolla you well know to be a traitor and a robber.'
And, giving no heed to the episcopal summons, they
drew up an indictment against the fiscal. When this
was told to La Baume, he could not contain himself.
His twofold title of prince and bishop filled him with
pride, and he could not bear the thought that these
citizens of Geneva disregarded his orders.</p>

<p>This affair only served to hasten the execution of
his plans. His mind was full of bitterness on account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">{550}</a></span>
of the heresy he had discovered in the city, and he
thought but of punishing those whom he looked upon
as traitors. It did not occur to the bishop that Geneva,
after undergoing a great transformation, was one day
to become the most active focus of the Reform. But,
without foreseeing such a future, he thought that if
the Reformation were established there, as at Zurich
and Berne, the provinces of Savoy, and others besides,
would erelong fall a prey to the contagion. He made
up his mind to oppose it in every way, and it must be
confessed that he had a right to do so; but two things
are to be regretted: the unholy mixing up of the
catholic cause with that of a traitor and thief, and the
means that the prelate employed.</p>

<p class="side">=THE BISHOP APPEALS TO THE KNIGHTS.=</p>

<p>These means he sought in violence. In order to
punish the huguenots he must have allies. Where
could he look for them except among the knights
of the Spoon? As prince and bishop of Geneva, he
would give a shape to this fraternity, and organise it
against his own episcopal city. He forthwith entered
into communication with its principal leaders: John
de Viry, sire of Alamogne; John Mestral, sire of
Aruffens; John de Beaufort, baron of Rolle; Francis,
sire of St. Saphorin; the sire of Genthod, a village
situated between Geneva and Versoix; and especially
Michael, baron of La Sarraz, whom the bishop called
'his dearly beloved cousin.' Without waiting for
these powerful lords to attack the city, he began to
carry on a little war himself. He put into prison
two Genevan cattle-dealers, who chanced to be in
the territory of St. Claude; ordered the Genevan
<i>goats and cows</i> to be seized, which were grazing on
the hills of Gex; and posted armed men on all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">{551}</a></span>
roads leading from Geneva to Lyons, with instructions
to stop his <i>subjects</i> and their friends, and to seize their
goods.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_830" id="Ref_830" href="#Foot_830">[830]</a></span></p>

<p>After this little war, the bishop turned his thoughts
to the great one. At first he wished to set in
motion his own vassals, friends, and allies on the
western slopes of the Jura. 'Brother,' said he to the
Baron of St. Sorlin, 'call out our Burgundians.' His
negotiations with La Sarraz, Viry, and others having
succeeded, he issued a general appeal to the knights
of the Spoon. 'Gentlemen and neighbours of my
episcopal city,' he said, 'I have been informed of your
friendly disposition to aid me in punishing my rebellious
subjects of Geneva. And now, knowing that it
will be a meritorious work before God and the world
to do justice upon such evil-doers, I pray and require
you to be pleased to help me in this matter.' Many
of these gentlemen crossed the Jura to come to an
arrangement with him, and filled Arbois with their
indignation.</p>

<p>The 20th of August was an important day at the
residence of the prince-bishop; he had determined to
make war upon his flock, and this moment had been
chosen for the declaration. Pierre de la Baume was
not so cruel as his predecessor, the bastard of Savoy;
but his irritation was now at its height. If he chanced
to meet any Genevans who addressed him in respectful
language, he would smile graciously upon them, but 'it
was all grimace,' says the pseudo-Bonivard.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_831" id="Ref_831" href="#Foot_831">[831]</a></span>
When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">{552}</a></span>
they had quitted him, La Baume once more indulged
in angry and threatening words. The convents, the
commandery of Malta, and the college of the canons
of Arbois were still more violent in their complaints.
On the 20th of August a meeting took place at the
priory. The knights of the Spoon, who had found
the wine of Arbois excellent, arrived with their
swords, their coats of mail, and their cloaks. The
bishop, proud of having such defenders, invited them
near the chair where he was seated, and graciously
handed them their commissions to make war upon his
subjects. 'We, Pierre de la Baume,' they ran, 'bishop
and prince of Geneva, having regard to the insolence,
rebellion, treason, and conspiracies that some of our
subjects of Geneva are daily committing against us
and our authority ... imprisoning our subjects and
our officers without orders, assuming our rights of
principality, and threatening to do worse; ... being
resolved <i>to maintain our Church in her authority and
to uphold our holy faith</i>, have commissioned and
required our friends and relatives to aid us in punishing
the rebels, and, if need be, to proceed by force of
arms.' (Here follow the names of these friends, the
Baron of La Sarraz, and the other lords mentioned
above.) The prelate ended the document by a declaration
that these gentlemen 'had full authority from
him, and that, in confirmation, he had written these
letters with his own hand at Arbois, on this 20th of
August in the year 1530.' He had signed the
papers: <i>Bishop of Geneva</i>. The gentlemen thanked
the prelate, promised to do all in their power, and,
quitting Franche-Comté, returned to their castles to
make ready for the campaign, repeating to one another,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">{553}</a></span>
as they rode along, that it was very necessary to
maintain <i>the authority of the Roman Church</i> in Geneva,
and to uphold <i>the holy faith</i>, and seeming very proud
that such was the object of the crusade they were
about to undertake.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_832" id="Ref_832" href="#Foot_832">[832]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=LUTHERANS IMPRISONED.=</p>

<p>The bishop's alarm was not without foundation.
The huguenots, even those most inclined to protestantism,
did not possess much evangelical light; they were
struck rather with the superstitions of Rome than with
their own sins and the grace of God. There were
nevertheless some Genevans and a few foreigners
living in Geneva, who displayed great zeal, and
replied to the bishop's violence by going about from
place to place seeking to enlighten souls. The gentlemen
of Savoy, who had just made an alliance with
the bishop, had seen this with their own eyes. 'They
enter the cottages, and even venture into our castles,'
said the knights, 'everywhere preaching what they
call the Word of God.' The peasants listened rather
favourably to the addresses of these evangelists; but,
says Balard, 'the gentlemen could not be prevented
from taking vengeance on such excesses.' When any
of these daring pioneers of the Reformation arrived at a
castle, or even at the village or town which depended
on it, the lord, exasperated that the heretics should
dare come and preach their doctrines to his servants
and vassals, seized them and threw them into his
dungeons.</p>

<p>Some envoys from Friburg who were going to Chambéry,
having halted on the road at the castle of one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">{554}</a></span>
their friends, heard of these doings; it happened, too,
that some of these huguenot prisoners (they may have
come from Berne) were confined in the place at which
they were stopping. As the Friburgers, although good
catholics, were not in favour of employing brute force
in matters of religion, they found means to touch the
hearts of their persecutors, and succeeded in having
these fervent evangelists set at liberty. They then
continued their journey to Chambéry. But the duke
had hardly given them audience before he said to
them with bitterness: 'I have to complain, gentlemen,
that you go about in search of prisoners in my
country, and that the people of Geneva are trying to
make my people as bad as themselves.... I will not
put up with such disorders.... I cannot prevent my
nobles from taking vengeance.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_833" id="Ref_833" href="#Foot_833">[833]</a></span>
But the Genevans
were equally unwilling to submit to the ill-treatment
to which some of their number had been exposed, and
accordingly Robert Vandel and John Lullin were despatched
in all haste to Berne and Friburg to urge on
the arrival of these noble auxiliaries. It is probable,
however, that certain serious rumours which were
beginning to circulate in Geneva were the principal
cause of their mission.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_834" id="Ref_834" href="#Foot_834">[834]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the autumn of 1530, and as the chiefs of
German catholicism had assembled at Augsburg to
deliberate upon the means of destroying protestantism
in the empire, the duke and the bishop, the two great
enemies of Geneva, appointed a meeting at Gex, at the
foot of the Jura, to deliberate on the means of expelling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">{555}</a></span>
both liberty and the Gospel from the city of the Leman.
'Lutheranism is making considerable progress
in Geneva,' said the bishop to the duke; 'attack the
city; for my part I will employ in this work the
revenues of my see and of my abbeys, and even all my
patrimony.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_835" id="Ref_835" href="#Foot_835">[835]</a></span>
The duke might have had reasons for
delaying the war. His brother-in-law the emperor,
and the other catholic princes assembled at Augsburg,
thought they could not be ready before the spring,
and desired that protestantism should then be attacked
on all points at once. But passion prevailed with
Charles III. Aspiring to the sovereignty of Geneva, it
was important for him to play the principal part in the
attack against that city; and when once Geneva was
taken, he would prove to all the world that, in accordance
with the system of the cardinals, it would be
necessary to establish there some ruler more powerful
than a bishop, in order to prevent future revolts.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_836" id="Ref_836" href="#Foot_836">[836]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=LA SARRAZ HEADS THE KNIGHTS.=</p>

<p>The Baron of La Sarraz was already at work; he
was a man fitted to succeed Pontverre. Prejudiced
like him against Geneva, liberty, and the Reformation,
he was less noble, less virtuous, and less headstrong
than that unhappy gentleman, but surpassed him in
genius and in ability. He had sworn that either he or
Geneva should give way and perish.... The oath was
accomplished, but not in the manner he had anticipated.
The knights of the Spoon, summoned by the bishop,
excited by La Sarraz, supported by the fugitive mamelukes,
and approved of by the duke, took the field immediately.
They intercepted the provisions intended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">{556}</a></span>
for Geneva, and sharp skirmishes occurred every day.
If any citizen went beyond the walls to look after his
farm or attend to his business, the knights would fall
upon him and beat him, shut him up in one of their
castle dungeons, and sometimes kill him. But all this
was a mere prelude. The bishop came to an understanding
with the Baron of La Sarraz, through his
cousin, M. de Ranzonière. Another conference took
place at Arbois towards the middle of September 1530.
After a long conversation about the heresy and independence
of Geneva, and the strange changes and singular
perils to which that city and the surrounding
provinces were exposed, they decided upon a general
attack.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_837" id="Ref_837" href="#Foot_837">[837]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 20th of September, the men-at-arms of the
knights of the Spoon, the Burgundians of the bishop,
and the ducal troops, made arrangements to surprise
Geneva. On the 24th of September, some well-disposed
people came and told the citizens that the Duke
of Nemours was at Montluel in Bresse, three leagues
from Lyons, with a large army. It was the Count of
Genevois, younger brother of the Duke of Savoy, whom
his sister, the mother of Francis I., had created Duke
of Nemours in 1515. He was, as we have already
remarked, an able man, and, even while courting the
Genevans, desired nothing better than to destroy their
city. His sister, Louisa of Savoy, whose hostile disposition
towards the Gospel we have seen, thought it a
very laudable thing to crush a place in which the protestants,
persecuted by her in France, might find an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">{557}</a></span>
asylum. The six captains of Geneva, on hearing this
alarming intelligence, assembled their troops and addressed
them in a touching proclamation. This was
on Sunday, the 25th of September. 'We have been
informed,' they said, 'that our enemies will attack us
very shortly. We pray you therefore to forgive one
another, and be ready to die in the defence of your
rights.' The citizens unanimously replied to these
noble words: 'We are willing to do so.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_838" id="Ref_838" href="#Foot_838">[838]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=TROOPS MARCH AGAINST GENEVA.=</p>

<p>The next day, Monday, the 26th of September, a
man of Granson, coming from Burgundy, confirmed the
news of the danger impending over the city. 'Everything
is in motion on our side,' he told them. 'M. de
St. Sorlin has declared that <i>God and the world</i> are enraged
against Geneva (it was the favourite expression
of his family); companies of arquebusiers are about
to cross the Jura; the gentlemen of the Spoon are
approaching with a large number of armed men, and
the day after the feast of St. Michael they will enter
Geneva by force, to kill the men, women, and children,
and plunder the city.' The man of Granson, at the
request of the syndics, hurried off to carry the news
to Berne and Friburg.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_839" id="Ref_839" href="#Foot_839">[839]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a singular thing, this expedition against
Geneva in behalf of the <i>holy faith</i>, for there was not a
church in the city where mass was not sung, and not
one where the Gospel was preached. It was still a
catholic city; but, we must confess, it contained little
really worthy of the name, except old walls, old ceremonies,
and old priests. Mass was performed, but the
huguenots, instead of listening to it, walked up and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">{558}</a></span>
down the aisles. The Reformation was everywhere
in Geneva, and yet it was nowhere. The bishop, the
duke, and even the emperor, who were not very acute
judges, confounded liberty with the Gospel; and seeing
that liberty was in Geneva, they doubted not that the
Gospel was there also.</p>

<p class="side">=GENEVA BLOCKADED.=</p>

<p>On Friday, the 30th of September, the enemy's
army debouched on all sides of Geneva. The six
captains of Geneva and their six hundred men got
their arms ready. At this moment envoys arrived
from Friburg, wishing to see, hear, and advise the
councils. They had hardly entered the city, when
the troops of Savoy, Burgundy, and Vaud were seen
preparing to blockade it. A Friburg herald left immediately,
to carry the news to his lords; but at
Versoix the ducal soldiers were on their guard; the
messenger was seized and conducted to the knight of
the Spoon who commanded in the castle. It was to
no purpose that he declared himself to be a Friburger:
'You wear neither the arms nor the colours
of Friburg,' was the reply; 'go back to Geneva.' And
as the herald insisted upon passing (he had had good
reasons for not putting on his uniform), the knights
maltreated him and drove him before them close up to
the drawbridge of Geneva, insulting him from time to
time in a very offensive manner. The night was
then approaching; the steps of the horses and the
shouts of the horsemen could be heard in the city; it
was believed that the assault was about to be made,
and some citizens ran off to ring the tocsin. The
alarm continued through the night.</p>

<p>The enemy had pitched their camp at Saconnex, on
the right bank of the Rhone and the lake, about half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">{559}</a></span>
a league from Geneva, in the direction of Gex and the
Jura. On Saturday, the 1st of October, they sallied
forth early in the morning, pillaged the houses round
the city, set fire to several farms, and returned to
their camp: this was a petty prelude to the meditated
attack. At this moment a second herald, coming from
Friburg, was brought in. He had been stopped at
Versoix, for nobody could pass that post in either
direction. The Friburgers, uneasy at receiving no news
from Geneva, had sent this man to learn whether their
friends were really in danger or not. 'What is your
business?' asked the officers. The herald, who had
learnt the story of his colleague, had recourse to a
stratagem which the usages of war justify, but
christian truth condemns. 'I am ordered,' he said,
'to go and tell our ambassadors that they must return
immediately; and that if Monsieur of Savoy needs the
help of my lords of Friburg, they will assist him.'
The Savoyards, delighted at the mission of the
Friburger, hastened to set him at liberty; he went on
to Geneva, and told the whole affair to the ambassadors
of his canton. The latter, extremely pleased
at his dexterity, asked him if he could once more make
his way through the triple barrier that the cavaliers
had raised between Geneva and Friburg. He was to
report that the state of affairs was as bad as could
be; and that Geneva, attacked by superior forces,
was on the point of falling. 'We have no time to
write,' they added, for they feared their letters
would be intercepted; 'but we give you our rings as
a token. Go speedily, and tell the lords of the two
cities (Berne and Friburg), that if they wish to
succour the city of Geneva, <i>they must do so now or</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">{560}</a></span>
<i>never</i>.' Prompt help from the Swiss could alone
preserve the liberties of Geneva. The cunning
Friburger departed; but even should he succeed in
making his way through the Savoyard troops lying
between Friburg and Geneva, what might not happen
before a Swiss army could arrive?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_840" id="Ref_840" href="#Foot_840">[840]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day, Sunday, the 2nd of October, the
episcopal army was put in motion; it surrounded the
city; a part of the Savoyard troops occupied the
suburb of St. Leger and the monasteries of St. Victor
and Our Lady of Grace; another part was drawn up
opposite the Corraterie. The Genevans could no
longer restrain themselves: the gates of the Corraterie
were thrown open, and a number of the more intrepid
sallied out upon the Savoyards, who received them
with their arquebuses: one citizen was shot dead, and
the others returned into the city. Erelong similar
skirmishes took place on every side, and the trainbands
of Geneva, firing upon the enemy from the
wall, killed several of them. Masters of the suburbs,
the Savoyard army waited until night to make the
assault. <i>Death and plunder</i> was the pass-word given
by the leaders.</p>

<p>The situation of Geneva became more critical every
hour. In the evening, just as the bell was ringing
for vespers, there was a gleam of light in the stormy
sky. Ambassadors arrived from Berne; they had passed
through the enemy's lines, doubtless in consequence
of their diplomatic character. They immediately
visited their Friburg colleagues, who made known to
them all their fears: 'Yet a few hours more,' they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">{561}</a></span>
said, 'and Romish despotism will perhaps triumph
over the Genevese liberties.' The Swiss did not lose
a moment, but despatched a herald, post-haste, to
demand immediate support. A part of the defenders
of Geneva went to their homes to take some slight
repose.</p>

<p class="side">=NIGHT ASSAULT.=</p>

<p>The night closed in, but a bright moon permitted
every movement to be observed which took place
without the city. At midnight the moon set: darkness
and silence for some time reigned upon the walls.
This was the hour fixed for the assault. The bands
of Savoy and Burgundy and the knights of the Spoon
moved forward without noise, and soon reached the
ditch, in readiness to attack the city. It was easy for
them to break in the gates and to scale the walls. The
sentries on the ramparts listened, and tried to make out
the movements of the enemy. The Genevans were all
determined to sacrifice their lives, but they were too
few to defend their homes against such an army.
They had to fear enemies still more formidable. It
was asserted that the governor of the Low Countries,
the pope, the Dukes of Lorraine and Gueldres,
and the King of France were all pushing forward
troops against the city. The alarm had been given
in the courts of Europe by a recent act of the
Landgrave of Hesse. He was negotiating a treaty
with the cantons of Zurich and Basle, by the terms of
which each of the contracting parties was bound to
support the others in case of violence against the cause
of the Gospel. 'Might not Philip do the same with
Berne and Geneva?' said some. 'Might not the latter
city become an asylum of the Reformation in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">{562}</a></span>
south, for the populations of the Latin tongue?...
No time must be lost in destroying it.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_841" id="Ref_841" href="#Foot_841">[841]</a></span></p>

<p>People were talking of these things at Augsburg.
The protestant princes and doctors had quitted that
city, where the famous diet had just ended: a month
had been given them to become reconciled with Rome.
But Charles V., who did not reckon much upon this
<i>entente cordiale</i> between the pope and Luther, had
declared that he would terminate the controversy
with the sword, and had given orders to raise a
powerful army to crush both protestants and protestantism:
that, however, was not to be done before
the spring of next year. One day, when the emperor
was conversing about Geneva with Duke Frederick and
other catholic princes,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_842" id="Ref_842" href="#Foot_842">[842]</a></span>
despatches were brought him
announcing the march of different armed bodies
against Geneva. Charles always displayed a prudence
and reserve in his plans, which proceeded as much from
nature as from habit. As his faculties had been
developed slowly, he had accustomed himself to
ponder upon everything with close attention; he had
decided in particular that not a shot ought to be fired
in Europe against the protestants before the spring of
1531, and had instructed his brother-in-law of Savoy
to that effect. Accordingly, when he learnt, in October,
that an attack was preparing against Geneva, he
gave utterance to his vexation. 'Ha!' he exclaimed,
'the Duke of Savoy is beginning this business too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">{563}</a></span>
soon!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_843" id="Ref_843" href="#Foot_843">[843]</a></span>
'These words give cause for reflection,'
said the deputies of Nuremberg, who reported them
to their senate. After Geneva, their own turn would
come, no doubt.</p>

<p class="side">=MYSTERIOUS RETREAT OF THE SAVOYARDS.=</p>

<p>Meanwhile, about one o'clock on a pitch-dark night,
the troops of the duke, the bishop, and the knights of
the Spoon had come up close to the ditch. But,
strange to say, they remained inactive. They neither
broke down the gates nor mounted the walls: on the
contrary, 'the nearer they approached,' says Balard,
who was in the city, '<i>the more their hearts failed them.</i>'
Besides the knights of Vaud and the leaders of
the Burgundian bands, there were in the besieging
army a certain number of officers holding their commissions
immediately from his highness the duke.
On a sudden these Savoyard captains drew back; they
moved away, and left the others at the edge of the
ditch. This unexpected defection surprised every
one: the soldiers asked what it meant.... The troops
fell into disorder, a panic soon ran through their
ranks, and in a moment there was a general flight,
their only exploit being the plundering of the suburbs.</p>

<p>The officers of Savoy, as they retired, said that
the duke 'had commanded them to withdraw under
pain of death.' He had indeed received the emperor's
orders not to begin the war before the spring; but he
could not resolve to arrange his plans in harmony
with those of his illustrious ally. Always anxious
to make himself master of Geneva, he had let things
take their course. A more pressing message from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">{564}</a></span>
emperor had arrived. The duke, much vexed, had
communicated it with a bad grace to his captains.
Had it only reached them at the moment they were
making the attack? or did they hesitate at the very
time when, blinded by hatred, they were about to
escalade the walls in defiance of the orders of the puissant
emperor? Had their courage failed them at the
last step? This seems the most probable conclusion.
There is, however, a certain mystery in the whole
incident which it is difficult to penetrate. Geneva,
alone in the presence of a gallant and numerous army,
was defended during this memorable night by an unknown
and invisible power. The Genevans believed
it to be the hand of the Almighty. Did they not
read in Scripture that a city, inhabited by the people
of God, having been compassed by horses, and chariots,
and a great host, the mountain round about was
miraculously filled with horses and chariots of fire in
far greater numbers?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_844" id="Ref_844" href="#Foot_844">[844]</a></span>
None of these indeed had been
seen upon the Alps, but the arm of the Lord had
put the enemy to the rout. 'The bark of God's miracles'
had been once more saved in the midst of the breakers.
The citizens reiterated in their homes, in the streets,
and in the council, the expression of their gratitude.
'Ah!' said syndic Balard, 'the faint heart, the sudden
discouragement of those who had conspired against
the city, came from the grace and pity of God!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_845" id="Ref_845" href="#Foot_845">[845]</a></span></p>

<p>The citizens wished to open the gates and follow in
pursuit of the enemy; but the ambassadors of Berne
and Friburg restrained them. The flight was so extraordinary
that these warlike diplomatists feared that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">{565}</a></span>
it was a stratagem. 'You do not know,' they said,
'how great is the cunning of the enemy. Wait until
you receive help from our masters, which we hope
will soon arrive.'</p>

<p class="side">=FIFTEEN THOUSAND SWISS ARRIVE.=</p>

<p>In fact, fifteen thousand of those soldiers who were
the terror of Europe were then entering the Pays de
Vaud with ten pieces of cannon and colours flying,
and were marching to Geneva. Some of the citizens
regretted the arrival of these troops, who came (they
said) when they were not wanted, and who would be
an expense to the city; but the more far-sighted
thought their presence still necessary. The enemies
of the new order of things still threatened Geneva on
every side, and were even in Geneva, always ready to
renew the attack. It was necessary to put a stop to the
violence of these feudal lords and the intrigues of
the monks; it was necessary to free the country once
for all from the robbers who spread desolation all
around; and the Swiss army was looked upon as
called to accomplish this work. This was also what
the Bernese and Friburgers said, and they spared no
pains to deliver the inhabitants of the shores of the
Leman from their continual alarms. They did no
harm to the peasants, except that they 'lived upon
the good man;'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_846" id="Ref_846" href="#Foot_846">[846]</a></span>
but they captured, plundered, and
burnt the castles of the knights of the Spoon. The
garrisons fled at their approach, carrying away baggage,
treasures, and artillery across the lake to Thonon:
boats were continually passing from one shore to the
other. The priests and friars were not looked upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">{566}</a></span>
with very friendly eyes by the <i>Lutherans</i>, and here
and there they had their gowns torn; but not one of
them was wounded. One hundred and twenty Genevans,
encouraged by this news, put to flight at Meyrin
eight hundred soldiers of Savoy and Gex.</p>

<p>At noon on Monday, the 10th of October, the Swiss
army, with the avoyer D'Erlach at its head, marched
into Geneva. But where could they put fifteen
thousand soldiers in that little city? The citizens
received a great number; a part were quartered in
the convents. 'Come, fathers, make room,' said the
quartermasters to the Dominicans. The monks gave
up their dormitories very unwillingly; but that did not
matter: six companies, '<i>all Lutherans</i>,' were lodged
in the convent, and two hundred horses were turned
loose in their burial-ground to feed upon the grass.
The Augustine and Franciscan monasteries, as well as
the houses of the canons and other churchmen, were
also filled with troops. These men carried on the
controversy in their own fashion—that is, in a military
and not an evangelical manner. A great number
of them had to bivouac in the open air. The
Bernese artillerymen, who were posted round the
Oratory, situated between the city and Plainpalais,
felt cold during the night. They first began to examine
the chapel, and then entered it, and took away
the altar and the wooden images, with which they
made a good fire. They were not, however, yet at
their ease: these rough Helvetians, having no desire to
lie down or to remain standing all night, broke up a
large cross, and with the fragments made seats on which
they sat round the fire. Some Friburgers, observing
what they considered to be a sacrilege, went up to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">{567}</a></span>
Bernese and reprimanded them sharply, asking them
why they did not go and look for wood somewhere else.
'The wood from the churches is usually very dry,'
coolly answered the artillerymen. These catholic
Friburgers were no doubt superstitious; but perhaps
the Bernese were not very pious, and most of them,
while destroying the <i>idols</i> without, left those standing
that were within.</p>

<p class="side">=THE NUNS OF ST. CLAIRE.=</p>

<p>The Genevans anxiously looked about for quarters
for their guests, being unwilling to leave these confederates
without shelter, who had quitted everything
for them. As the city was not large enough, the
country was laid under contribution. At the extremity
of a fine promontory which stretches from the
southern shore into the lake, at Belle Rive, about a
league from the city, stood a convent of Cistercian
nuns, staunch partisans of the duke, and who were suspected
of intriguing in his favour, and of having been
greatly delighted when the Savoyard army had beleaguered
the city not long before. 'Come with us,' said
certain young huguenots to a Swiss company bivouacking
in the open air; 'we will provide you comfortable
quarters, situated in a beautiful locality.' They marched
off immediately. The nuns, whose hearts palpitated
with fear, were on the watch, and, looking from their
windows, they saw a body of soldiers advancing by the
lake. Hastily throwing off their conventual dress,
they disguised themselves and took refuge in the neighbouring
cottages. At last the troop arrived. Were
the Genevans and Bernese irritated by this flight, or
did they intend to follow the custom of burning the
houses of those who plotted against the State? We
cannot tell; but, be that as it may, they set fire to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">{568}</a></span>
convent, not, however, to the church, and the house
itself suffered but little, for the nuns returned to it
soon after. When the flames were seen from Geneva,
they occasioned much excitement; but nothing could
equal that of the sisters of St. Claire.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_847" id="Ref_847" href="#Foot_847">[847]</a></span>
The poor
nuns, huddling together in their garden, looked at the
fire with terror, and exclaimed: 'It is a sword of
sorrow to us, like that which pierced the Virgin.'
They ran backwards and forwards, they entered the
church, they returned to the garden, and fell down at
the foot of the altar, and then, looking again at the
flames, devoutly crossed themselves. 'We must depart,'
they said, and immediately the best scholars
among them drew up, as well as their emotion permitted,
a humble petition addressed to the syndics.
'Fathers and dear protectors,' said they, 'on our
bended knees and with uplifted hands, we, being
greatly alarmed, entreat you by the honour of our
Redeemer, of his virgin mother, of Monsieur St. Pierre,
and Madame St. Claire, and all the saints of paradise,
to be pleased to allow us to go out from your city in
safety.' Three of the most devout members of the
council went to the convent to comfort them. 'Fear
nothing,' they said, 'for the city has not the least
intention of becoming Lutheran.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_848" id="Ref_848" href="#Foot_848">[848]</a></span></p>

<p>A certain consideration was shown towards the
sisters, by requiring them to find quarters for only
twenty-five soldiers, all Friburgers, 'good catholics,'
says one of the nuns, 'and hearing mass willingly.'
But alas! the mass did not make them more merciful.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">{569}</a></span>
'They were as thievish as the others,' says the same
nun. Shortly after their arrival they threatened to
break down the doors and the walls, if the nuns did
not supply them with as much to eat and drink as
they wanted. It is true that the sisters put the soldiers
upon spare diet, giving them only a few peas.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_849" id="Ref_849" href="#Foot_849">[849]</a></span>
This little garrison, however, was of advantage to the church
of St. Claire: it was the only place in Geneva where
the Roman worship was performed. The Friburgers,
at the request of the sisters, took post at the door, and
prevented the <i>heretics</i> from entering, but gave admission
<i>by order</i> to all the priests and monks of Geneva
who showed themselves. The latter came dressed as
laymen, carrying their robes under their arms; they
went into the vestry, put on their clerical costume,
entered the chapel, drew up round the altar, and
chanted mass <i>in pontificalibus</i>. When the service was
over, the nuns congratulated each other: 'What glory
Madame St. Claire has over Madame Magdalen, Monsieur
St. Gervais, and even M. St. Pierre!' It was a
great consolation and indescribable honour to them.</p>

<p>The mass, however, was not to have all its own
way in Geneva. The Bernese desired to have the
Word of God preached; consequently, on Tuesday, the
11th of October, they proceeded to the cathedral with
their evangelical almoner, and ordered the doors to
be opened. Some of them went into the tower and
rang the episcopal bells, after which the almoner went
up into the pulpit, read a portion of Scripture, and
preached a sermon. A great number of Genevans had
gone to the church and watched this new worship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">{570}</a></span>
from a distance. They did not fully understand it;
but they saw that the reading of God's Word, its explanation,
and prayer were the essential parts, and they
liked that better than the Roman form. From that
time, the evangelical service was repeated daily, and
'no other bell, little or big, rang in Geneva.' The
priests consoled themselves by thinking that 'the
accursed minister preached in German.' The <i>German</i>,
however, went further: he had brought with him some
copies of the Holy Scriptures in French, and French
translations of several of the writings of Zwingle,
Luther, and other reformers; and when the Genevans
who had heard him without understanding him went
to pay him a visit, he gave them these books, after
shaking hands with them, and in this way prepared
their minds for the work of the Reformation.</p>

<p class="side">=CASTLES TAKEN AND BURNT.=</p>

<p>While these books might be producing some internal
good, the Genevans were anxious for another reform.
They wished to purge the country of the outrages, robberies,
and murders which the nobility in the neighbourhood
of Geneva, still more than those in the Pays de
Vaud, had made the peaceful burghers endure so long.
This also was a reform, though different from that of
Luther and Farel. 'Come along with us,' they said to
the terrible bands of Friburg and Berne, 'and we will
lead you to these brigands' nests.' The Swiss troops,
guided by the Genevans, appeared successively before
the castles of Gaillard, Vilette, Confignon, Sacconex,
and others. They captured and set fire to many of
these haunts, where the noble robbers had so often
hidden their plunder and their prey. The terror of
the partisans of the old order of things now became
extreme. The sisters of St. Claire thought that everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">{571}</a></span>
was on fire round Geneva. 'Look!' said they,
standing on the highest part of their garden, 'look!
although the weather is fair, the sky is darkened by
the smoke.' They fancied it was the last day. 'Of a
surety,' they added, 'the elements are about to be dissolved.'
The desolation was still greater in the country.
The captain-general had issued an order forbidding all
marauding, but the soldiers rarely attended to it. The
peasantry were seen running away like sheep before
the wolf; the gentlemen hid themselves in the woods
or the mountains; and several noble dames, who had
taken refuge in miserable huts, 'were brought to bed
there very wretchedly.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_850" id="Ref_850" href="#Foot_850">[850]</a></span></p>

<p>Although certain accusations have been brought
against them, the nuns of St. Claire were sincere in
their devotion, and moral in their conduct; and while
the dissolute friars kept silence, these superstitious
but virtuous women appeared to stand alone by the
side of popery in its agony. Desiring to appease the
wrath of heaven, they made daily processions in their
garden, barefooted in the white frost, chanting low
the litanies of the Virgin and the saints 'to obtain
mercy.' They passed all the night in vigils, 'praying
to God in behalf of his holy faith and the poor world.'
After matins they lighted the tapers, and scourged
themselves; then bending to the earth, they exclaimed:
<i>Ave, benigne Jesu!</i> 'hail, gentle Jesus!'
Sister Jeanne affirms that by these means they worked
miracles. Indeed, one of the <i>mahometists</i> (huguenots),
having flung a consecrated wafer into a cemetery, it
could not be found again: 'the angels had carried it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">{572}</a></span>
away and put it in some unknown place.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_851" id="Ref_851" href="#Foot_851">[851]</a></span>
It was not very miraculous that so small an object could not
be found among the grass and between the graves of
a cemetery. A miracle more real was worked.</p>

<p>The Duke of Nemours, brother of the Duke of
Savoy, who, as we have seen, had come from France
with his men-at-arms to attack Geneva, laid aside his
warlike humour when he found the Swiss in the city,
and, wishing to conciliate the Genevans, repeated to all
who came near him that he had never intended to do
them any harm, and would punish severely everybody
who was guilty of violence towards them. A
truce was concluded at St. Julien. The definitive
treaty of peace was referred to a Swiss diet to be held
at Payerne. The bishop released the merchants, the
cows, and the goats he had seized, and the Genevans
set Mandolla at liberty; 'but,' adds Bonivard, 'I
was not taken out of Chillon.'<span

 <h3>CHAPTER XII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">GENEVA RECLAIMED BY THE BISHOP AND AWAKENED BY THE
 GOSPEL.<br />
 (<span class="smc">November 1530 to October 1531.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="side">=IMPERIAL LETTER TO GENEVA=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THUS had failed the attack of the bishop-prince
against his city; and it was much to be feared
that such an act, instead of restoring his power, would
only accelerate his fall. Pierre de la Baume saw this,
and resolved to employ other means to regain in
Geneva the authority he had lost.</p>

<p>The thought that the Helvetic league was to be
the arbiter between Geneva and her bishop-prince
oppressed him like a nightmare: he did not doubt
that the diet would pronounce against him. A clever
idea occurred to him. 'If,' said he, 'I could but
have the emperor as arbiter, instead of the Swiss....
Surely the monarch, who is preserving the papacy in
Germany, will preserve it also at Geneva.' Charles V.
and the catholic party were still at Augsburg; and
the bishop would have desired to substitute a congress
of princes for a diet of republicans. 'In truth,' said
the emperor, when this petition was laid before him,
'we should not like the rights of the most reverend
father in God, the Bishop of Geneva, to be prejudiced....
They are of imperial foundation; and it is our duty,
therefore, to maintain them.' Charles had never been
more irritated against the protestants than he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">{574}</a></span>
now. It was the middle of November: the imperial
<i>recess</i> had just been rejected by the evangelicals,
because the emperor (they said) had not authority
to command in matters of faith.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_853" id="Ref_853" href="#Foot_853">[853]</a></span>
The deputies of
Saxony and Hesse had left without waiting for the
close of the diet. The imperialists assured the friends
of the Bishop of Geneva that he could not have chosen
a better time, and that his cause was gained. On the
19th of November proclamation was to be made in
Augsburg of the re-establishment 'of one and the
same faith throughout the empire.' On the evening
before, while this was being drawn up, the emperor
called his secretary, and dictated to him the following
letter, addressed to the people of Geneva:—</p>

<div class="top">
<div class="left1">'<span class="smc">Dear Liegemen</span>,</div>
</div>

<p style="text-indent:2em">'We have been informed that there is a question
between you and our cousin, the Duke of Savoy,
about matters touching the rights of our well-beloved
cousin and counsellor, the Bishop of Geneva. We
have desired to write to you about that, enjoining
you very expressly to send to our imperial authority
persons well informed on all points in dispute
between the bishop and yourselves. We shall demand
the same of the said lords, the duke and the bishop,
our cousins, for the settlement of your differences,
which will be for the welfare and tranquillity of both
parties. You will thus learn the desire we have that
<i>our subjects</i> should live in peace, friendship, and concord.</p>

<p>'Dear liegemen, may God watch over you!</p>

<p>'At Augsburg, 18th of November, 1530.</p>

<div class="foot">
<div class="right1">'<span class="smc">Charles</span>.'</div>
</div>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">{575}</a></div>

<p class="side">=ANSWER OF THE GENEVESE.=</p>

<p>This letter from his imperial majesty created a great
sensation in Geneva. It was known that Charles V.
was preparing to reduce mighty princes, and every
one perceived the danger that threatened the city.
'What!' said the people, 'we are to send deputies to
Augsburg, and perhaps to Austria, where they will
meet those of the bishop and the duke ... and the
emperor will be our judge!' The councils assembled
frequently without coming to any decision as to the
answer to be returned. First one and then another
was commissioned to draw it up. Councillor
Genoux produced a draft signed 'Your very humble
subjects.'—'We are not subjects,' exclaimed the
huguenots. At length they decided on writing as
follows:—</p>

<p>'Most serene, most invincible, very high and
mighty Prince Charles, always august. For this
long time past, we, in defence of the authority and
franchises of our prince-bishop and city of Geneva,
have suffered many vexations, great charges, expenses,
and dangers, proceeding from the most illustrious
duke. Quite recently we were surrounded by
armed men, his subjects, and outrageously attacked.
Nevertheless, by God's will and the kind succour of
the magnificent lords of Berne and Friburg, we have
been preserved from this assault—to relate which
would be wearisome to your majesty.' The council
added that, as the settlement which the emperor
desired to undertake would be arranged at Payerne
before the Swiss diet, they could not profit by his
good intentions, and concluded by commending to him
the city of Geneva, 'which, from desiring to observe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">{576}</a></span>
its strict duty, would have been almost destroyed
but for the grace of God.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_854" id="Ref_854" href="#Foot_854">[854]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus did the little city boldly decline the intervention
of the great emperor. The duke and the bishop
had hoped that Charles V., who was in their opinion
called to destroy the Reformation in Germany, would
begin by crushing it in Geneva. Accordingly, when
the news of the Genevese refusal reached the ears of
the duke and the bishop, their indignation knew no
bounds. 'Since these rebels reject the peaceful
mediation of the emperor,' they said, 'we must bring
the matter to an end with the sword.' They once more
resolved to take the necessary steps, but with as much
secresy as possible, so that the Swiss should not be
informed of them. The Duke of Nemours, who had
not made use of his army, instructed ten thousand
lansquenets who were at Montbéliard to move as
quietly as they could behind the Jura, arrive at St.
Claude, descend as far as Gex, and, two days before
the opening of the diet of Payerne which the bishop
so much dreaded, <i>suddenly take Geneva by storm, set
it on fire</i>, and, leaving a heap of ashes behind them,
retire rapidly into Burgundy before the Swiss could
have time to arrive. At the same time messengers
were sent to all the castles of the Pays de Vaud,
inviting the gentlemen to hold themselves in readiness.
On his side, the Duke of Savoy, who was then
at Chambéry, made 'great preparation' of armed men
and adventurers, both Italian and French. Everything,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">{577}</a></span>
he said, was to be completed with the greatest
secresy.</p>

<p class="side">=DECISION OF THE DIET OF PAYERNE.=</p>

<p>But Charles was less discreet than his brother; he
could not keep silence, but boasted of the clever <i>coup
de main</i> that he was preparing. On the other hand,
a man coming from Montbéliard to Berne reported
that he had seen ten thousand soldiers reviewed in
that town. At this intelligence, the energetic lords
of Berne desired all the cantons to hold themselves
in readiness to succour Geneva, and threatened the
gentry of the Pays de Vaud to waste their country
with fire and sword if they moved. Meanwhile the
council called out all the citizens. Thus the mine
was discovered, the blow failed, and the duke, once
more disappointed in his expectations, left Chambéry
for Turin.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_855" id="Ref_855" href="#Foot_855">[855]</a></span>
The diet which met at Payerne, even
while conceding the vidamy to the duke (which he
was not in a condition to reclaim), maintained the
alliance of Geneva, Berne, and Friburg, and condemned
Charles III. to pay these three cities 21,000
crowns. Geneva and Berne desired more than this:
they demanded that Bonivard should be set at liberty—'if
perchance he be not dead,' they added. The
Count of Chalans replied that M. St. Victor was 'a
lawful prisoner.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_856" id="Ref_856" href="#Foot_856">[856]</a></span></p>

<p>As neither war nor diplomacy had succeeded in
restoring the prince-bishop to his see, he had recourse
to less secular means: he turned to the pope,
who determined to grant the city a marvellous favour
by which he hoped to attach once more the bark of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">{578}</a></span>
Geneva to the ship of St. Peter. The heroism which
the sisters of St. Claire had shown when the Swiss
had come to the help of the city in October 1530, had
touched the pontiff: among the conventuals of Geneva
the only men were the women. The pope therefore
granted a general pardon to all who should perform
certain devotions in the church of that convent. On
Annunciation Day (March 25) this remarkable grace
was published throughout the country.</p>

<p class="side">=PILGRIMAGE TO ST. CLAIRE.=</p>

<p>An immense crowd from all the Savoyard villages
flocked to the city, 'in great devotion,' on the first
day. Chablais, Faucigny, Genevois, and Gex were
full of devotees strongly opposed to the Reformation;
they were delighted at going to pay homage in Geneva
itself to the principles for which they had so often
taken up arms. As they saw these long lines approach
their walls, the citizens felt a certain fear. 'Let us
be on our guard,' they said, 'lest under the dress of
pilgrims the knights and men-at-arms of the Spoon
should be concealed.' They suddenly closed the city
gates. The pilgrims continuing to arrive soon made
a crowd, and, being fatigued with their long march,
exclaimed in a pitiful voice: 'Pray open the gates, for
we have come from a distance.' But the Genevans
were deaf. Then appeared the pilgrims from Faucigny,
energetic and vigorous men, who got angry,
and finding words of no avail, they forced the gates,
and proceeded to the church of St. Claire, where they
began unceremoniously to say their <i>Paters</i> and <i>Aves</i>.
According to a bull of Adrian VI., it was sufficient to
repeat five of these to obtain seventy thousand years of
pardon.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_857" id="Ref_857" href="#Foot_857">[857]</a></span>
The colour mounted to the cheeks of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">{579}</a></span>
of the huguenots, who would have resisted the unlawful
intrusion; but the Faucignerans continued their
devotions as calmly as if they had been in their own
villages. Then the syndics went to St. Claire (it was
the hour of vespers), accompanied by their sergeants
'with drawn swords and stout staves,' and made the
usual summons for these strangers to leave the city.
Upon the refusal of the Savoyards, the public force
interfered; the Faucignerans resisted, blows were
exchanged, and finally these extraordinary pilgrims
were compelled to retire without having gained their
pardon. This scene increased the dislike of the
Genevans to the Romish ceremonies. To publish
indulgences was a curious means of strengthening
catholicism in Geneva. Pope Clement VII. forgot
that Leo X. had thus given the signal for the
Reformation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_858" id="Ref_858" href="#Foot_858">[858]</a></span></p>

<p>When these scenes were described at Rome, they
excited great irritation. The sacred college determined
to try again, and to exhibit in the very midst
of this heretic population a still more striking act of
Roman devotion. Clement VII. called his secretary
and dictated to him, 'of divine inspiration,' a new
pardon, to which the Bishop of Geneva affixed his
<i>placet</i>, and which inflicted the penalty of excommunication
on any who should oppose it. This bull was
published in the Savoyard country adjacent to Geneva.
The parish priests had scarcely announced the pardon
from their pulpits, ere the villages were astir, and
men and women, old and young, made their arrangements
to go and seek the glorious grace offered them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">{580}</a></span>
in the city of the huguenots. The Genevans, friends
of religious liberty and legality, determined to offer no
hindrance to these devotions. But they took their
precautions, and the captain-general called out a
strong guard. The pilgrims approached, staff in
hand, some carrying a cross on their shoulders; and
erelong a great crowd of Savoyards appeared before
the walls. Here they were compelled to halt. At
each gate were arquebusiers, a great many of them
huguenots, who searched the pilgrims lest they
should carry swords beneath their clothes, in addition
to their staves. The examination was made,
not without much grumbling, but no arms were
found.</p>

<p>Then the devoted multitude rushed into the city,
and crowded into the church of St. Claire as if it had
been that of Our Lady of Loretto. The Genevans
suffered the pilgrims to go through all their forms
without obstruction. If the Savoyards wished to perform
their devotions, they reckoned also, as is usual
in affairs of this kind, upon eating and drinking, and
that abundantly. The crowd for this part of the pilgrimage
was so great, that the tavern-keepers, for
want of room, were forced to set tables in the open
air. This mixture of praying and drinking made the
spectators smile, and some of the huguenots gave vent
to their sarcastic humour: 'Really,' said one, 'this
pardon is quite an ecclesiastical fair' (<i>nundinæ ecclesiasticæ</i>)!
'The fair,' said another, 'is more useful
than people imagine. By these pilgrimages the priests
revive the flagging zeal of their flocks. They are
nets in which the simple birds come and are caught.'
'I very much fear,' added a third, 'that in order to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">{581}</a></span>
sell her indulgences, the Church makes many promises
which God certainly will not fulfil.... It is a pious
fraud, as Thomas Aquinas says.'—'Let them alone,'
said others, 'let them bring their money ... and
then, when the plate is well filled, we will empty it.'
They did not proceed to such extremities: the syndics
merely forbade the money to be spent out of the
city.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_859" id="Ref_859" href="#Foot_859">[859]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=PRIDE OF THE NUNS OF ST. CLAIRE.=</p>

<p>The sisters of St. Claire rejoiced. The pope had
honoured them in the sight of all christendom; their
monastery was on the way to become a celebrated
place. They believed themselves to be the favourites
of God and of the heavenly intelligences, and imagined
that angels would come to their assistance. As the
plague was then raging in Geneva, they saw—surprising
miracle!—the hosts of heaven leaving their
glorious abodes to preserve the convent: the plague
did not visit it. All the nuns were convinced that
this was due to a miraculous intervention. And when
the sisters, in church or in refectory, at vespers or at
matins, conversed about this great grace, they whispered
to one another: 'Three wondrously handsome
and formidable knights, each having a beautiful
shining cross on his forehead, keep watch before the
gate.... And when the wicked plague appears, she
sees them straight in front of her, and flees away,
fearing the brightness of their faces.' Sister Jeanne
de Jussie informs us of this miraculous fact, and concludes
her narrative with this pious exclamation: 'To
God be the honour and praise!' Some sensible men
afterwards asked why these knights, 'with the shining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">{582}</a></span>
cross on their foreheads,' had not stationed themselves
at the gates of Geneva to prevent the entrance
of that other plague (as Rome called it), the Reformation?</p>

<p>The means which the pope had selected for reannexing
Geneva to Rome, had quite a different effect: they
produced a revival of religion. The Roman indulgence
aroused the Genevans, and made them seek for a real
pardon. Had not Luther, fourteen years before, proclaimed
at Wittemberg that '<i>every true christian
participates in all the blessings of Christ, by God's
gift, and without a letter of indulgence</i>?'—'This doctrine,'
said certain huguenots who had returned from
a journey through the cantons, 'is received in Switzerland,
and not at Zurich and Berne alone. There are
many people of Lucerne and Schwytz even, who prefer
God's pardon to the pardons of the pope.'</p>

<p>An invisible hand was at that time stretched over
the city, and holding a blessing in reserve for it.
Farel, who was on the shores of the lake of Neufchatel,
was informed of the evangelical movement
which followed the noisy devotions of the Faucignerans,
and wrote about it immediately to Zwingle,
his friend and counsellor. This was in October
1531: yet a few more days, and the reformer of
Zurich was to meet his death on the battle-field of
Cappel. This awakening of Geneva was the last news
which came to rejoice his oppressed soul. 'Many in
that city,' wrote Farel, 'feel in their hearts holy
aspirations after true piety.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_860" id="Ref_860" href="#Foot_860">[860]</a></span>
And, according to this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">{583}</a></span>
energetic reformer, it was something more than vague
movements of the soul that they felt. 'Several Genevans,'
he wrote another day to Zwingle, 'are meditating
on the work of Christ.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_861" id="Ref_861" href="#Foot_861">[861]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">='DE CHRISTO MEDITARI.'=</p>

<p>Thus, then, did that city of Geneva, which had been
so engrossed with political independence, begin to
reflect on Jesus Christ. It was the new topic which the
Reformation presented everywhere to the consideration
of earnest men. In Germany, Switzerland, France,
and England, still more than at Geneva, serious minds
were beginning to meditate on Christ—<i>de Christo
meditari</i>. Some did so in a superficial manner; others
devoted themselves to it in the depths of their soul;
and holy thoughts found a home in the houses of the
citizens, in the colleges, in obscure cells, and even on
the throne. 'Christ is the Redeemer of the world,'
thought these meditative minds, 'the restorer of the
union with God, which sin destroyed.... Christ came
to establish the kingdom of God upon earth.... But
no one can enter that kingdom unless God pardons
his sins.... In order that we may find peace, not only
must our souls be relieved from the penalty, but our
consciences must be delivered from the feeling of the
sin that keeps it apart from its God.... An atonement
is necessary.... Christ, like those whom he came to
save, a man like them, is at the same time of an eternal
and divine nature, which has given him power to ransom
the entire people of God, and to be the principle
of a new life.... He took upon himself the terrible
penalty which we deserved.... His whole life was one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">{584}</a></span>
continuous expiatory suffering.... But the crowning
of his sorrows, and what gave them truly the character
of expiation, was his death.... Christ, uniting himself
to humanity through love for us, suffered death under
a form which bears in the most striking manner the
character of a punishment, that is to say, the pain
of a malefactor condemned by a human tribunal....
He, the Holy One, wishing to save his people, was
made sin upon the cross.... He was treated as the
representative of sinful humanity.... He, the beloved
of the Father, endured for rebellious men the most
deadly anguish, the entire abandonment by God....
From that hour the people of God enjoy the remission
of their sins, they are reconciled with God, they
have free access to the Father.... That sacrifice is
of universal comprehensiveness; no one is excluded
from it ... and yet no one receives the benefit of it,
except by a personal appropriation, by being united
to Jesus Christ, by participating, through faith, in his
holy and imperishable life.'</p>

<p>Such, in the sixteenth century, were the meditations
of elect souls in many a secret chamber, and it is
in this way that the Reformation was accomplished.
Perhaps one or two Genevans had similar thoughts;
but, generally, their knowledge was not very advanced,
and most of the huguenots desired rather to be delivered
from the bishop and the duke than from sin and condemnation.
Farel did not conceal from Zwingle his
anxieties in this respect, and said, in his letter from
Granson: 'As for the degree of fervour with which
the Genevans seek after piety—it is known only to
the Lord.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_862" id="Ref_862" href="#Foot_862">[862]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">{585}</a></div>

<p class="side">=FAREL FEELS THE WANTS OF GENEVA.=</p>

<p>No one interested himself more than Farel in the
reformation of Geneva. That year he was at Avenche,
Payerne, Orbe, Granson, and other places; and everywhere
he ran the risk of losing his life. In one place
a sacristan threatened him with a pistol; in another,
a friar tried to kill him with a knife concealed under
his frock; but Farel never thought of himself. Of
intrepid heart and indomitable will, always burning
with desire to promote the triumph of the Gospel, and
prepared to confront the most violent opposition, he
felt himself strongly drawn to Geneva as soon as he
heard that the Reformation had to contend with powerful
adversaries there. He then fixed his eyes on that
city, and during his long career never turned them
away from it. In the midst of his labours at Granson,
by the side of the lake, near the old castle, on the
famous battle-field, Geneva occupied his thoughts.
He reflected that although it already had a reputation
for heresy, there was in reality no true reform. What!
shall the Reformation die there before it is born? He
desired to see the Word of God preached there publicly,
in an appropriate, vivifying, effective manner, and, as
Calvin said, 'by pressing the people importunately.'
He desired to see the pulpit become the seat of the
prophets and apostles, the throne of Christ in his
Church. No time must be lost. The Reformation
would be ruined in Geneva, and the new times would
perish with it, if the huguenots, who had ceased to
listen to the mass, were contented, as their only
worship, with walking up and down the church while
the priests were chanting. The ardent passions and
warlike humour of the Genevese alarmed him. 'Alas!'
he said, 'there is no other law at Geneva than the law
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">{586}</a></span>
of arms.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_863" id="Ref_863" href="#Foot_863">[863]</a></span>
He desired to establish the law of God
there. He would have liked to go there himself, and
perhaps he would have carried away some by his lively
eloquence, and alarmed others by the thunders of his
voice; but he owed himself at this time to the places
he was evangelising at the peril of his life. If he
quitted the work, Rome would regain her lost ground.
He therefore looked about him for a man fitted to
scatter through the city the seeds of the Word of
God.</p>

<p class="side">=CALLS TOUSSAINT TO GO THERE.=</p>

<p>Pierre Toussaint, the young canon of Metz, had
quitted France, at the invitation of Œcolampadius,
after his sojourn at the court of the Queen of Navarre,
and had joined Zwingle at Zurich.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_864" id="Ref_864" href="#Foot_864">[864]</a></span>
Farel came to
the determination of sending Toussaint to Geneva:
they had occasionally preached the Gospel together
since 1525. 'Make haste to send him into the Lord's
vineyard,' he wrote to Zwingle, 'for you know how well
fitted he is for this work. I entreat you to extend a
helping hand.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_865" id="Ref_865" href="#Foot_865">[865]</a></span>
And, as if he foresaw the importance
of the reformation of Geneva, he added: 'It is no
small matter: see that you do not neglect it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_866" id="Ref_866" href="#Foot_866">[866]</a></span>
Urge Toussaint to labour strenuously, so as to redeem by
his zeal all the time he has lost.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_867" id="Ref_867" href="#Foot_867">[867]</a></span>
Zwingle executed
the commission. Toussaint, one of the most amiable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">{587}</a></span>
among the secondary personages of the Reform, listened
attentively to the great doctor, and at first
showed himself inclined to accept the call.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_868" id="Ref_868" href="#Foot_868">[868]</a></span>
Zwingle spared no pains to bring him to a decision: he set
before him what the Gospel had already done in Geneva,
and what remained to be done. 'Enter into this
house of the Lord,' he said. 'Rend the hoods in
pieces, and triumph over the shavelings.... You will
not have much trouble, for the Word of God has
already put them to flight.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_869" id="Ref_869" href="#Foot_869">[869]</a></span>
He did not mean that
Toussaint should literally tear the friars to pieces, for
the expression is figurative; but the energy of Farel
and Zwingle, and what he heard of the Genevan persecutions,
alarmed the poor young man. He had
quitted the court of Francis I. because of the worldliness
and cowardice he had encountered there; and
now, seeing in Geneva monks and priests, <i>bishopers</i>
and <i>commoners</i>, huguenots and mamelukes, he shrank
back in terror, as if from a den of wild beasts. He
had said 'No' to the court, he said 'No' to the energetic
and impetuous city. Geneva wanted heroes—men
like Farel and Calvin. The project failed.</p>

<p>Farel was vexed. He who had never shrunk from
any summons could not succeed in sending an evangelist
into this city!... He called to mind that all
help comes from a God of mercy, and in his anguish
turned to the Lord: 'O Christ,' he said, 'draw up thy
army according to thy good pleasure; pluck out all
apathy from the hearts of those who are to give thee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">{588}</a></span>
glory, and arouse them mightily from their slumber.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_870" id="Ref_870" href="#Foot_870">[870]</a></span>
The moment was soon to arrive when he would go
himself to Geneva; but before he appeared there, his
prayer would be answered. God, whom he had invoked,
was to send there within a few months a strong
and modest man, who would prepare the way for
Farel, Calvin, and the Reformation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile several Genevans, who did not understand
that a conversion of the heart is necessary,
wished to effect at least a negative reform, which
would have consisted in doing away with the mass,
images, and priests. The more daring asked why
Geneva should not do like Zurich, Berne, and Neufchatel.
'Yes,' answered the more prudent, 'if the
Friburgers would permit.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_871" id="Ref_871" href="#Foot_871">[871]</a></span></p>

<p>These desires for reform, weak as they were, alarmed
the Romish party. Friars, priests, and bigots got up
an agitation, and, going in great numbers before the
procurator-fiscal, conjured him to lay aside his apathy,
seeing that this new religion would change everything
in Geneva, and deprive the bishop not only of his
spiritual jurisdiction, but of his secular authority also.
The fiscal, who was empowered to watch over the
rights of the prince, called for a severe inquiry upon
all suspected persons.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_872" id="Ref_872" href="#Foot_872">[872]</a></span>
At these words there was
silence in the assembly: some of the members of the
council looked at one another, and felt ill at ease, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">{589}</a></span>
they were among the number of the suspected. The
fiscal spoke out more plainly, and filled the hall with
complaints and clamour. 'Let us destroy heresy!'
he repeated.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_873" id="Ref_873" href="#Foot_873">[873]</a></span>
The council, perplexed to the highest
degree, evaded the matter by doing nothing either
for or against it.</p>

<p class="side">=BERNE AND FRIBURG AT GENEVA.=</p>

<p>The fervent catholics next proceeded to the hotel
where the Friburg ambassadors were staying. 'If
Geneva is reformed,' said the latter, 'there is an end
to the alliance.' The Friburgers did more than this:
leaving their lodgings, they accosted the more decided
liberals, and repeated to them in a firm tone: 'If
Geneva is reformed, there is an end to the alliance!'
The huguenots hurried off to the Bernese ambassadors;
but the battle of Cappel was not far off, and it
was a matter of doubt whether the Reformation could
be preserved even in Berne and Zurich. The Bernese
received the Genevans coldly, and the latter returned
astonished and incensed. 'Alas!' said Farel, 'the
Bernese show less zeal for the glory of Christ than the
Friburgers for the decrees of the pope.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_874" id="Ref_874" href="#Foot_874">[874]</a></span></p>

<p>A new difficulty arose. The huguenots would
have desired to march to the deliverance of Zurich
and the reformed, while the catholics wished to support
Lucerne and the smaller cantons. On the 11th
of October—the very day of the battle of Cappel, but
it was not yet known—Berne demanded a hundred
arquebusiers of Geneva; and the next day Friburg
wrote desiring them to send all the help they could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">{590}</a></span>
against the heretical cantons. Which side should
Geneva take? 'Let us refuse Friburg,' said some.
'Let us refuse Berne,' said others. The former called
to mind the assistance which the most powerful republic
in Switzerland had sent them; the latter remembered
that Friburg had espoused the cause of
Geneva when Berne was against them. The council,
impelled in contrary directions, resolved to preserve a
just balance, and extricated themselves from their
embarrassment by the strangest middle course. They
resolved that a hundred Genevans should go and fight
in favour of the Reformation, and appointed Jean
Philippe, one of the most zealous huguenots, to command
them; after which they also gave Friburg a
favourable answer, and elected syndic Girardet chief
of the auxiliaries intended for the catholics.<span

<p class="side">=GENEVA AGAIN IN DANGER.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE news of the war between the catholics and the
reformed having reached Turin, the duke thought
it a favourable opportunity for attacking Geneva. It
was reported that five thousand lansquenets were
approaching on the side of Burgundy, ten thousand
Italians on the side of the Alps, and that all the
states of his highness beyond the mountains were in
motion to fall upon the city. 'There are certain
heads in Geneva,' said the duke, 'that I purpose
to set flying.' The Genevans lost not a moment.
'Let everything be destroyed that may obstruct the
defence of the city,' said the council. 'Let all the
suburbs be levelled—Eaux Vives on the left shore of
the lake; St. Victor, at the other side of St. Antoine;
St. Leger, up to the Arve; and the Corraterie as far as
the Rhone. Let every man keep a good look-out; let
no one be absent without leave; let those who are away
return to defend the city; and let solemn prayers and
processions be made for three days.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_876" id="Ref_876" href="#Foot_876">[876]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, while Lucerne and the smaller cantons were
attacking Zurich, the Duke of Savoy and the gentlemen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">{592}</a></span>
of the Leman were preparing to attack Geneva.
These two cities were in the sixteenth century the
capitals of protestantism in Switzerland. Geneva,
however, was still filled with priests and monks, while
the choirs of all the churches reechoed with the
matins and other chants of the Romish ritual,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">De pieux fainéants y laissant en leur lieu,</div>
<div class="verse">A des chantres gagés, le soin de louer Dieu.</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>How did it happen that Geneva was at this time
coupled with Zurich? It is because that city, though
not yet won over to the Reformation, was predestined
to be so: a solitary example, probably, of a state
exposed to great dangers, not so much on account of
what it is, as on account of what it will be. The
beginnings of the evangelical faith to be found there
were so very small, that they would not have sufficed
to draw upon it the anathemas of the bishop and the
armies of the duke; but the election of God was
brooding over it; God prepared it, tried it, and delivered
it, because of the great things for which he
destined it. The adversaries of the Gospel seemed
to have a secret presentiment of this; and they desired
therefore to destroy by the same blow the
city of Zwingle and that which was to be the city of
Calvin.</p>

<p class="side">=DEFEAT AT CAPPEL: TRIUMPH OF ROME.=</p>

<p>All the citizens were afoot. Some armed with
arquebuses mounted guard; others marched out
with their mattocks to level the suburbs. At this
moment a messenger arrived from Switzerland announcing
the defeat at Cappel: Zurich had succumbed....
At first the huguenots could not believe the
mournful news; they made the messenger repeat it;
but it was soon confirmed from various quarters, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">{593}</a></span>
the friends of independence and of the Reformation
bent their heads in sorrow. The arm in which they
had trusted was rudely broken. The protestant party
throughout Switzerland was disheartened, while the
Roman party rejoiced. It was told at Geneva that
the mass had been restored at Bremgarten, Rapperschwyl,
and Soleure, and in all the free bailiwicks,
and that the monks were returning in triumph to
their deserted cells. Was it possible for the Reformation
to plant its banners on the shores of Lake Leman,
at the very moment when it was expelled from those
places where it seemed to have been so firmly established?</p>

<p>The Genevan catholics anticipated their triumph.
The death of the Swiss reformer was (they thought)
the end of the Reformation; they had only to strike
the final blow. Their secret meetings became more
numerous; detestable plots were concocted. The
heroes of the old episcopal party, resuming their arrogant
look, walked boldly in the streets of Geneva,
some rattling their swords, others sweeping the ground
with their long robes. If they chanced to meet any
<i>suspected</i> persons, they made contemptuous gestures
at them, picked quarrels with them, insulted, and
even struck them, and the outrages remained unpunished.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_877" id="Ref_877" href="#Foot_877">[877]</a></span>
The Friburgers, in particular, thought
everything was lawful against the evangelicals,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_878" id="Ref_878" href="#Foot_878">[878]</a></span> and
desiring to subdue Geneva, emulous of the Waldstettes
at the Albis, they marched through the streets in small
bands, and whenever they discovered any huguenot,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">{594}</a></span>
they surrounded him, carried him off, and threw him
into prison without trial.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_879" id="Ref_879" href="#Foot_879">[879]</a></span>
In this way the partisans
of the bishop expected to restore him to his episcopal
throne. Pierre de la Baume was getting ready to
ascend it again.</p>

<p>The huguenots, astonished at the perpetration of
such outrages in the presence of the Swiss, and even by
the Swiss, applied once more to the Bernese, but in
vain. The latter were unwilling to countenance a
struggle in Geneva which they were checking in other
quarters. 'Let there be no petulance, no violence,'
they said; 'we have the orders of the senate.' But,
as the Genevans were not disposed to remain quiet,
the envoys of Berne assumed a grave countenance, and,
putting on a magisterial haughtiness, dismissed their
unseasonable visitors. The Genevans withdrew murmuring:
'What scandalous neglect and cowardice!'
they said; 'Messieurs of Berne think a great deal
more of this world than of the world to come.'—'The
senate of Berne,' repeated Farel, 'would not put up
with the slightest insult to one of their ambassadors,
and yet they make light of serious insults offered to
the Gospel of Christ.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_880" id="Ref_880" href="#Foot_880">[880]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=APPROACH OF THE DUKE AND HIS ARMY.=</p>

<p>The defeat of Zurich redoubled the energy of Duke
Charles. Desirous of adorning his brows with laurels
similar to those of the victors at Cappel, he gave orders
for a general attack. The troops of Vaud and Savoy
surrounded Geneva, and cut off the supplies; the
boats were seized on both shores of the lake, and the
duke arrived at Gex, three leagues from the city,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">{595}</a></span>
with a strong force of cavalry to superintend the
assault. Under these gloomy auspices the year 1532
began in Geneva. The danger appeared such that,
at seven in the evening of the 2nd of January, all the
heads of families assembled and resolved to keep night
and day under arms, to wall up the gates, and to
die rather than renounce the Swiss alliance and their
dearest liberties. A greater misfortune was about to
befall them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_881" id="Ref_881" href="#Foot_881">[881]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 7th of January, five days after this courageous
resolution, three Bernese deputies, De Diesbach,
De Watteville, and Nägueli, appeared before the
council. Sadness was depicted on their faces, and
everything betokened that they were the bearers of a
distressful message. 'We are come from Gex, where
the duke is lying,' they said. 'He consents to treat
with you, if you will first renounce the alliance with
the cantons. Remember, he is a mighty prince, and
able to do you much harm. You have not yet paid
for the last army we sent you; we cannot set another
on foot. We conjure you to come to some arrangement
with his highness.'</p>

<p>During this speech the Genevans flushed with
anger and indignation. They could not understand
how the proud canton of Berne could ask them to
renounce the cause of independence and the Swiss
alliance. The deputy having ended his address—the
general council of the people had been convened to
hear it—the premier syndic replied: 'We will listen
to no arrangement except how to preserve the alliance.
The more we are threatened, the firmer we shall be.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">{596}</a></span>
We will maintain our rights even till death. We
trust in God and in Messieurs of the two cities. And
if, to pay you what we owe, we must pawn our property,
our wives, and our children, we will do so. As
for the alliance, we are resolved to live and die for it.'
The syndic had scarcely done speaking, when all the
people cried out: 'So be it! We will do nothing
else—we will die first!' The arquebusiers of Jean
Philippe and of Richardet were of the same mind.
The ambassadors thought it strange that they should
dare to resist Berne. 'We will carry your answer
back to our lords,' they said, 'and they will do what
pleases them.' They then retired. The people held
up their hands, and all swore to be faithful to the
alliance.</p>

<p>The Bernese envoys had left. The people were in
great agitation. The cause of liberty had just been
vanquished at Cappel; the armies of the duke surrounded
the city, and the Swiss desired to cancel the
alliance. Geneva was not exempt from secret terrors:
the women shed tears, and even the men felt an
oppression like that of the nightmare; but enthusiasm
for liberty prevailed over every fear. Deprived of
the help of men, the Genevans raised their eyes to
heaven. Many of them experienced extraordinary
emotions, and were the victims of strange spectral
hallucinations. One night, the sentries posted on
the walls saw seven headless horsemen, dressed in
black, keeping guard around the city. They were
dressed in black, for all Geneva was in mourning;
they were without heads, for no one could reckon
upon preserving his own; and then these Genevans
fancied, in their enthusiasm, that they could defend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">{597}</a></span>
Geneva, even when their heads were off. The duke,
having learnt that some mysterious allies had come to
the help of the city, quitted Gex, and hurried off to
Chambéry. It is probable, however, that his conference
with the three lords of Berne had more influence
in arresting the execution of his designs, than the
apparition of the seven black horsemen.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_882" id="Ref_882" href="#Foot_882">[882]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=GOD PREPARES GENEVA BY TRIAL.=</p>

<p>The trials, the terrors, the repeated attacks that
Geneva was forced to undergo at the hands of her
enemies, are the characteristics of her history at the
epoch of the Reformation. Her citizens, plundered,
hunted down, captured, thrown into the dungeons of
the castles, always between life and death, lived continually
in the apprehension of an assault, and almost
every year their fears were changed into terrible realities;
of this we have seen several instances, and we
shall see more. There is probably no city of the
sixteenth century which arrived at the possession of
truth and liberty through such great perils. When
their supplies failed, when their communications, with
Switzerland were interrupted, when no one could leave
the city, when all around the arms of the Savoyards
were seen flashing in the rays of the sun, the citizens
no doubt displayed an heroic courage; but yet the
women and the aged men, and even men in the vigour
of life, felt a mortal fear and anguish. 'Christians are
not logs of wood,' it was said subsequently in this city,
and we may well apply the words to the Genevans of
this epoch; 'they are not so devoid of human feeling,
that they are not touched by sorrow, that they do not
fear danger, that poverty is not a burden to them, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">{598}</a></span>
persecution sharp and difficult to bear. This is why
they feel sad when they are tried.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_883" id="Ref_883" href="#Foot_883">[883]</a></span>
Long ago in the
early days of Christianity, famines, earthquakes, plagues,
persecution, and afterwards, at the period of the invasion
of the barbarians, the devastations with which
that calamity was attended, made serious souls feel the
presence of God, and led them to the cross. An earthquake
which threw down part of the city of Philippi,
terrified a gaoler, until then hardened in superstition,
humbled him, and made him listen to the teaching of
the disciples which he had previously despised;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_884" id="Ref_884" href="#Foot_884">[884]</a></span>
and, later still, a similar calamity in Africa brought a
great number of pagans to confess the Gospel and be
baptised.</p>

<p>It was by such trials as these that Geneva was now
prepared. God was ploughing the field which he wished
to sow. Distresses and deliverances continually repeated
revealed to thoughtful men the power of God:
to this even the Registers of the Council bear witness.
Did this rough school lead any souls further? Were
there any who sought beyond the world for life incorruptible?...
The inward travail of men's minds is
generally concealed, and the chroniclers give us no
information on this point (it is not their department);
but we cannot doubt that the end for which God sent
the trial was attained. Perhaps at that time there
were souls which, in the midst of the evils they saw
around them, were led to discover in themselves the
supreme evil—sin; perhaps in some private chamber
humble voices were then raised to heaven; perhaps
the judgments of God, which were suspended over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">{599}</a></span>
their heads and those of their wives and children, induced
some to dread the last judgment; and perhaps
there were many who embraced the eternal love, that
inexhaustible source of salvation, who believed in the
Gospel of the Son of God and found peace therein.
We know not what took place in the secret depths of
men's hearts; but certainly the times which we are
describing were times of trial which contributed to
make Geneva what it subsequently became: it was a
'burning furnace from which came forth fine brass.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_885" id="Ref_885" href="#Foot_885">[885]</a></span>
If Geneva shone out in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, it was partly because at the epoch of the
Reformation it had been sorely tried, and, if the expression
be allowable, 'brightly burnished.'—'We
are as it were annealed in the furnace of God,' may be
said of this city, 'and the scum of our faith has been
thus purged away.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_886" id="Ref_886" href="#Foot_886">[886]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=SWISS PATRICIANS CANCEL THE ALLIANCE.=</p>

<p>On the 7th of February, 1532, five ambassadors—two
from Berne, and three from Friburg—with
Sebastian de Diesbach at their head, appeared at
Geneva before the Council of Two Hundred; they
were the representatives of the Swiss aristocracy, of
those proud captains who figured in battles and
appeared in the courts of kings. They discharged
their mission with as little ceremony as they observed
in taking cities, and demanded that Geneva
should renounce its alliance with the Swiss and put the
Duke of Savoy again in possession of his supremacy....
What will the Genevans do? Even Friburg,
which had at first appeared favourable to them, failed
them now.... Two hundred voices exclaimed: 'We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">{600}</a></span>
will die sooner!' The next day, when the general
council was assembled, the greatest excitement prevailed
among them; everybody seemed eager to speak
at once; loud clamours arose on every side: 'All the
people began to shout,' say the minutes of this assembly.
The language of Diesbach was urgent, imperative, and
threatening.... A hurricane was blowing over Geneva;
the tree must bend or break. But it neither bent nor
broke. The ambassadors, amazed and indignant, returned
to their own country.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_887" id="Ref_887" href="#Foot_887">[887]</a></span></p>

<p>The Genevans, left alone, asked what was to be done....
The cup was overflowing. Suddenly a happy idea
crossed the minds of certain patriots. Although the
patricians and pensioners are opposed to the rights of
Geneva, will not the people, and the grand council
which represents them, be in favour of liberty? When
the Reformation was established at Berne, in 1528, the
noblest resolutions were formed. The indigent had
been clothed with the church ornaments, the pensions
of the princes renounced, and the military capitulations
which bound the Swiss to the service of foreign
powers abolished. Then the enthusiasm had cooled
down; the pensioners regretted the old times; they
tampered with the more influential people of the city,
and exasperated them against the alliance with Geneva
which displeased their old master the duke. 'Let
us make an attempt,' exclaimed some of the Genevese,
'to revive in Berne the noble aspirations for Reform
and liberty.' Robert Vandel and two other deputies
departed for the banks of the Aar.</p>

<p>Vandel was well suited for this mission. Ever since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">{601}</a></span>
the day when he saw his aged father illegally seized
by the bishop and thrown into prison, he had given
his heart to independence, as he subsequently gave it
to the Gospel. He knew that the people had retained
their sympathy for Geneva, and that if the patricians
prevailed in the little council, the citizens prevailed
in the great council: he therefore appeared before
this body. He explained to them the dangers of the
Genevans, their love of independence, and their resolution
to risk everything rather than separate from the
Swiss. His language moved the hearts of the Bernese,
and the good cause prevailed. 'We will maintain the
alliance,' they said; 'and, if necessary, we will march
to defend your rights.' Friburg adopted the resolutions
of Berne.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_888" id="Ref_888" href="#Foot_888">[888]</a></span>
Thus after the trial came the
deliverance; Geneva began to breathe freely. Yet
another sorrow was in store for it.</p>

<p class="side">=RESIGNATION AND DEATH OF HUGUES.=</p>

<p>On the 20th of February, Besançon Hugues appeared
before the council and resigned all his functions.
'I am growing old,' he said (he was only forty-five);
'I have many children, and I desire to devote myself
to my own affairs.' There is no doubt that the motives
assigned by Hugues had some part in his determination;
we may, however, ask if they were the only ones.
He watched attentively the movement of men's minds
in Geneva, and, being devoted to Roman-catholicism
and the bishop, he could not help seeing that the
opposite party was gaining more followers every day.
He had spared neither time, trouble, fortune, nor health
to bring about the alliance with the Swiss. Seeing
that it existed no longer solely in the parchments of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">{602}</a></span>
the archives, but in the hearts of the people, he thought
that he had fulfilled his task, and that for the new work
Geneva ought to have new leaders. If Hugues was
not old, he was ailing; he already felt the approaches
of that disease which carried him off a few months
later. He declined rapidly, and breathed his last towards
the end of the year.</p>

<p>The death of Besançon Hugues did not proceed
from an ordinary sickness: he died of a broken heart.
Although still a catholic, at the moment when the
Reform was about to enter his country, a crown ought
to be laid upon his grave. The continual anxiety
which the perils of Geneva had caused him; more than
forty official missions; his incessant labours in the
Genevan cause; the new burdens continually imposed
upon him; the reverses which rent his heart; his precipitate
flight, his dangers on the roads and in the
cities, cold, watchings, and the cares of a family—('I
commend to you my poor household,' he said sometimes
in his letters to the council); his disappointments;
the reproaches he had to endure from both
parties; his struggles with the pensioners, the agents
of Savoy, the knights of the Spoon, and some of his
fellow-citizens—all these vexations contributed to his
disease and death. The head of Besançon Hugues did
not fall under the sword of the executioner, like those
of Berthelier and Lévrier; but the pacific hero sank
under the weight of fatigue and sorrow. An invisible
sword struck him; and it may be said that the deaths
of the three great men of Genevan emancipation were
the deaths of martyrs.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">AN EMPEROR AND A SCHOOLMASTER.
 (<span class="smc">Spring 1532.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="side">=THE EMPEROR'S NEW SCHEME.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">JUST as the noble citizen, who had defended with
such devotedness the independence of his country,
had retired from the stage of the world, new plots
were got up against Geneva; but new strength came
also to her help. An emperor was rising against
the city, and a schoolmaster was bringing it the everlasting
Word.</p>

<p>The imperial court was then at Ratisbon, where
the Germanic diet was to assemble. The Duke and
Duchess of Savoy, who could not make up their minds
to resign Geneva, had ordered their ambassador accredited
to Charles V. to solicit the influence of that
prince in order to induce the bishop, his partisan, to
cede his temporal principality to the duke's second
son. The duchess, who appears to have been anxious
to bring about this cession, made every possible exertion
to attain her object. The emperor, who was very
fond of Beatrice, answered: 'I desire this arrangement,
because of the singular love, goodwill, and
affection I feel towards my dearly beloved cousin and
sister-in-law.' He added, moreover, that he desired
it also 'in the interest of the holy faith and for the
preservation of mother Church.' He undertook to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">{604}</a></span>
persuade Pierre de la Baume to transfer his temporality
to the young prince; and, that he might bring
the negotiation to a favourable issue, he applied to
the Count of Montrevel, the head of the bishop's
family. On the 14th of April, 1532, he dictated and
forwarded the following letter to that nobleman:
'The emperor, king, duke, and count of Burgundy,
to his very dear liegeman: We require and order you
very expressly, that as soon as possible, and at the
earliest opportunity and convenience, you proceed to
the Bishop of Geneva, and tell him, as you may see
most fitting, the desire we have that he should <i>please
our said cousins</i>, the duke and duchess; employing
with him soft words of persuasion, according to your
accustomed prudence. He can all the easier yield to
our prayer, because, as the successor-designate of the
Archbishop of Besançon, he must necessarily leave
Geneva to reside in that city.' The emperor, moreover,
used his influence with the Marshal of Burgundy,
the Baron of St. Sorlin, Pierre de la Baume's brother.
The prelate was to be attacked on every side.
Charles's recommendations could hardly have been
more urgent if the safety of the German empire had
been at stake.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_889" id="Ref_889" href="#Foot_889">[889]</a></span></p>

<p>The duke, who was delighted at these letters of the
emperor, began to take such measures as would enable
him to profit by them. Since the puissant Charles V.
gives Geneva to his son, he will go in quest of the
young prince's new states. In the following month
(May 1532) everything foreboded that some new
attack was preparing against Geneva. There was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">{605}</a></span>
great commotion in the castles; trumpets were sounding,
banners flying, and priests raising loud their
voices. It might have been imagined that they
were preparing for a crusade like those which had
taken place of yore against the Albigenses or the
Saracens. The Genevans, who had not a moment's
repose, mournfully told one another the news. 'In
the states of Savoy there are loud rumours of war,'
they said; 'the nobles are enraged against the evangelicals,
whom they call <i>Lutherans</i>; and some of the
gentry are assembled already, and going to and fro
under arms.' The citizens did not give way to dejection;
on the contrary, the knowledge of these intrigues
and preparations made them long the more earnestly
for the emancipation of Geneva. They said that from
the day when the pope had deprived the citizens of
the choice of their ruler, and had nominated creatures
or members of the house of Savoy as bishops at Geneva,
there had been in the city nothing but disorders, violence,
extortion, imprisonment, confiscations, tortures,
and cruel punishments. They asked if it was not time
to return to the primitive form of Christianity, to the
popular organisation of the Church; they repeated
that Geneva would never secure her independence
and her liberty, except by trusting to the great principles
of the Reformation. 'Zurich,' they said, 'has
resumed the rights which Rome had taken away: it
is time that Geneva followed her example.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_890" id="Ref_890" href="#Foot_890">[890]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=NEGATIVE PROTESTANTISM INSUFFICIENT.=</p>

<p>The Reformation was neither a movement of liberty
nor a philosophical development, but a christian, a
heavenly renewal. It sought after God, and, having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">{606}</a></span>
found him, restored him to man: that was its work.
But, at the same time, wherever it was established, at
least under the Calvinistic form, civil liberty followed it.
We must acknowledge, however, that the reformers,
with the exception of Zwingle, did not trouble themselves
much about this. It was grace that filled them
with enthusiasm. It was the great idea of a free
pardon, and not artillery, which shattered the power
of the pope. Every man was then invited to the foot
of the cross, to receive immediately from Christ, and
through no sacerdotal channel, an inestimable gift.
But Christianity, which the priesthood had monopolised,
vitiated, and made a trade of during the middle
ages, became common property in the sixteenth
century. It passed from the pomps of the altar to
men of humble and contrite heart, from the gloomy
and solitary cloisters to the domestic hearth, from
isolated Rome to universal society. Once more
launched into the midst of the nations, it everywhere
restored to man faith, hope, and morality, light, liberty,
and life.</p>

<p class="side">=OLIVÉTAN ARRIVES AT GENEVA.=</p>

<p>At the very time when a beautiful princess was
coveting Geneva, an ambitious duke intriguing, and
courtiers agitating, and when a puissant monarch was
granting his imperial favours, a humble schoolmaster
arrived in the city. And while all those pomps and
ceremonies were among the number of things worn
out and passing away, this teacher brought with him
the principles of a new life. Farel, as we have seen,
ardently desired that the Word of God should be
circulated and even publicly preached at Geneva.
He thought that then only would the Reformation be
truly established and independence secured. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">{607}</a></span>
probable that the person who arrived in this city, and
whom he had long known, was sent by him; but we
have no proof that such was the case. However, this
man was not, properly speaking, a preacher; he was
merely a schoolmaster, and yet he was to perform a
work greater than that of the emperor. At that time
Geneva passed for protestant; but her protestantism
was limited to throwing off despotism and superstition.
But it is not sufficient to reject what is false; the truth
preached by Christ and the apostles must be believed.
<i>Faith</i> is the principle of the Reformation. There was
at Geneva, to some extent, that negative protestantism
which rejects not only the abuses of popery, but also
evangelical truth itself; which can create nothing,
and which is little else than a form—and certainly
one of the least interesting forms—of philosophy. If
Geneva was to be reformed, to become a centre of light
and morality, and to maintain her political independence,
she must have a positive and living christianity;
and it was this that Olivétan, Farel, and Calvin were
about to bring her.</p>

<p class="side">=CHARACTER OF CHAUTEMPS.=</p>

<p>In the street of the Croix d'Or, not far from the
Place du Molard, lived an enlightened, wealthy, and
influential citizen, Jean Chautemps, a member of council.
He was a quiet and conscientious man, yielding
unhesitatingly to his convictions. Chautemps valued
learning highly, and having sons desired to see them
well educated. People spoke to him of a Frenchman,
born at Noyon, in Picardy, who, after a long residence
at Paris, had been compelled to leave France in consequence
of one of the attacks so frequently made
upon the <i>Lutherans</i> at that time. 'Besides,' added his
informant, 'he is a very learned man.' Indeed, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">{608}</a></span>
being either a Reuchlin in Hebrew or a Melanchthon
in Greek, he had a sound knowledge of both
languages; it was his practice to read the Holy Scriptures
in the original text, and he was fond of inserting
in his writings passages from the Old Testament, where
they still appear in beautiful Hebrew characters, in the
midst of his antiquated French. His name was Peter
Robert Olivétan—the same who, during his residence
in Paris, had had the happiness of bringing to a knowledge
of evangelical truth one of his cousins and fellow-townsmen,
John Calvin. Chautemps, considering it
fortunate to have such a master for his children, received
him into his house.</p>

<p>Calvin's cousin boldly set to work. He taught his
patron's children, and, as it would appear, some
others that had been placed with them. He taught
with love and clearness, according to 'the right mode'
of Mathurin Cordier, whom he had known at Paris.
He believed, as Calvin says, that 'roughness and servile
austerity excite children to rebellion, and extinguish
in them the holy affections of love and reverence,'
and he strove 'by moderate and kind treatment
to increase in them the will and readiness to
obey.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_891" id="Ref_891" href="#Foot_891">[891]</a></span></p>

<p>The schoolmaster, as he is termed in the Registers
of the Council of Geneva, did not restrict himself to
teaching Latin and Greek. He was simple and
modest, and calls himself, in the preface to the book
which has immortalised him (the translation of the
Bible), '<i>the humble and lowly translator</i>.' But God
had kindled a divine fire in his heart. He believed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">{609}</a></span>
that the christian ought to carry a lighted lamp in
his hand to show others the way of life, and he never
failed to do so. He sometimes accompanied Chautemps
to the churches, and was observed to be deeply
moved by the errors which he heard there; he would
leave the temple in agitation, return home, and, seated
with his patron, refute by Holy Scripture the opinions
of the priests, and faithfully explain the true Christian
doctrine. The councillor, who had early sided with
those who inclined towards the Reformation, was
struck with these conversations, and, far from resisting
the truth that was set before him, joyfully yielded
himself to it. He presently displayed, according to
Froment's testimony, 'if not a perfect knowledge, at
least a great desire for learning, with much love and
zeal to show himself as a friend of the Reformation.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_892" id="Ref_892" href="#Foot_892">[892]</a></span>
From that hour the pious councillor always came forward
whenever there was a question of upholding the
evangelical cause in Geneva. When that great missionary,
Farel, arrived, Chautemps was among the first
to welcome him. When a dispute occurred with the
curate of St. Magdalen's, he was one of those who defended
the teaching of the Scriptures.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_893" id="Ref_893" href="#Foot_893">[893]</a></span>
And subsequently
he boldly declared, in full council, that he
desired to live according to the Gospel and the Word
of God.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_894" id="Ref_894" href="#Foot_894">[894]</a></span></p>

<p>Olivétan's zeal was not confined to the house in
which he lived; he laboured to make the Gospel
known to the councillor's friends, and even to everybody
whom he found accessible to the Divine Word.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">{610}</a></span>
He exerted himself, and overcame obstacles; by means
of the Scriptures he endeavoured to 'point out <i>with
gentleness</i>' to the priests the errors which they taught,
and would not allow himself to be hindered by any fear.
Such zeal was not without danger, for the priests
had still much power in Geneva. Chautemps and his
friends accordingly advised Olivétan to be prudent,
lest he should come to harm; but the schoolmaster
said like his cousin: 'It is God's will that his truth
should be proclaimed, happen what may; it must be
published, even should the depths of hell pour forth
their rage against it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_895" id="Ref_895" href="#Foot_895">[895]</a></span>
Olivétan once reproved a priest
with so much boldness that the latter stirred up all
the clergy against him, and he was ordered (without
being brought to trial) to leave the city; but this
belongs to a later time.</p>

<p>Conversation did not suffice, and if any persons
showed a desire to learn the new doctrine, Olivétan
explained it to them. He did not do so before large
audiences; it was generally to small parties. Yet a
document speaks of assemblies held not only in private
houses, but in public, in the open places, and in front
of the churches.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_896" id="Ref_896" href="#Foot_896">[896]</a></span>
Olivétan, therefore, like his illustrious
relative, called to mind that in the beginning of
christianity the doctrine of the Lord did not remain
'hidden as it were in little comers, and that never was
thunder heard so loud and so piercing as the sound of
the preaching of the Gospel, reverberating from one
end of the world to the other.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_897" id="Ref_897" href="#Foot_897">[897]</a></span>
He sometimes quitted
the humble conventicle and preached the Word of truth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">{611}</a></span>
under the vault of heaven. Alarmed at the great disorders
in which those men indulged who were one
day to bear the name of 'libertines,' he attacked the
conscience with holy intrepidity.</p>

<p class="side">=OLIVÉTAN'S MISSION.=</p>

<p>One day, one of those 'private assemblies' was
held, of which the emperor had complained to the
syndics. It was, we may suppose, in the house of
Chautemps or some other huguenot (public meetings
were, I think, rare exceptions) in the street of the Croix
d'Or or of the <i>Allemands</i>, so called because some German
Switzers, friends of the Reformation, lived in it.
A few men and women, most of them known to the
master of the house, came and took their seats on the
benches in front of the evangelist. Olivétan, who saw
before him souls slumbering in false security and heedless
of the Supreme Judge, 'magnificently discharged
the embassy intrusted to him' (according to Calvin's
expression). 'One day,' he said, 'when thou shalt
hear the Lord calling thee to judgment, will there be
found anything in thee but fear and trembling, flight
and concealment? Look! Access to the Lord is
cut off, because of sin. With whom wilt thou take
refuge? In what place wilt thou find relief? God, the
avenger of sin, from whom nothing can be hid, is
everywhere present ... and everywhere terrifies the
guilty conscience.'</p>

<p>Then, imagining that he saw some of those Genevans,
whose morals, as depraved as those of the monks,
alienated them from the Gospel, he exclaimed: 'The
flesh excludes the Spirit, and stops the way, so that
the entrance of the heart is not opened to it. The flesh
desires present pleasures, it follows vanity, it carefully
seeks after the delights of the body, by eating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">{612}</a></span>
and drinking, by idleness, licentious pursuits, and
other such things, in which it is entirely absorbed.
Reason, illumined by the Spirit, strives after good
things, and fights against the flesh; but the sensual
man is nothing more than a brute, and gives himself
up entirely to things that belong to brutes.'</p>

<p>Among those who sat on the humble benches and
listened to the preacher, were also some of those intellectual
men, numerous in Geneva, who would have
liked to come to the faith, but whom the doctrine of
Christ astonished and even alarmed. 'You believe,'
said the evangelist, 'and yet you do not believe. You
willingly hear the words of salvation, and yet you are
terrified at them. There is nothing that we hear from
the mouth of the Saviour which, without a mediator,
should not be terrifying to us, and the flesh is quite
dismayed that it should be necessary to possess such
faith.'</p>

<p>Then the schoolmaster raised the trumpet of the
Gospel to his lips and announced the great mystery
of Redemption, without concealing what the Greeks
would have called its <i>foolishness</i>. 'Let us turn then,'
he exclaimed, 'to the Mediator, who has consummated
the alliance and purified us by his own blood, with
which our consciences are sprinkled and watered. The
Old Covenant always depended on the blood of beasts;
the New Covenant depends on new blood. Eternal
Redemption was effected by an eternal sacrifice. The
alliance is indissoluble, perpetual, and perfect through
the eternal blood which was of God.... The kingdom
of the Messiah has no end; its king must therefore be
immortal; and the new men, also immortal, are citizens
of an everlasting kingdom.'</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">{613}</a></div>

<p>The huguenots were fond of debating, even unseasonably.
Some of those seated in front of Olivétan
were astonished at hearing this doctrine of Christ's
sacrifice set forth, and maintained that, if they were to
judge from facts, it did not do much to free man from
sin. 'No doubt,' said Olivétan, 'if the Holy Ghost
does not teach us. We cannot attain true holiness
if the Holy Ghost, who is the reformer of hearts, is
absent. By the Spirit of Jesus Christ the remains
of sin in us diminish little by little. The Spirit of
Christ burns gently and cleanses away the stains of
the heart.... What a profound mystery! He who
was hung upon the cross, who even ascended into
heaven to finish everything, comes and dwells in us,
and there accomplishes the perfect work of eternal
Redemption.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_898" id="Ref_898" href="#Foot_898">[898]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus spoke the tutor of Councillor Chautemps'
children.</p>

<p>Olivétan was a mysterious personage, a singular reformer.
At Paris he called Calvin to the Gospel, and
gave him to Christianity as the apostle of the new
times. At Geneva, he was the forerunner of his illustrious
relative; like a pioneer in the forest, he cut
down the secular trees, and prepared the soil into
which his pious and mighty successor so copiously
scattered the seed. Later, as we shall see, he
gave to the reformed French Church its first Bible,
a translation which, revised by Calvin, so greatly
advanced the kingdom of God. Perhaps Olivétan,
during his residence in Geneva, may have thought
that his cousin would hereafter occupy this post. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">{614}</a></span>
appears in history only as the precursor of the
reformer, and Calvin had hardly set foot in this city
when Olivétan crossed the Alps, went to Italy, even
to the city of the pontiffs, as if he desired now to
accomplish a new work, to come to close quarters with
the papacy, and prepare Rome for the Reformation as
he had prepared Geneva. But there he suddenly disappeared—poisoned,
as some say. There is a veil
over his death as over his life. He is spoken of no
more, and scarcely any one appears to know either his
work or his name. But we must not anticipate: we
shall meet him again erelong.</p>

<p>Olivétan certainly played an important part in the
great change which has renewed modern society, and
his name deserves to be enrolled among those which
are carved on the foundation-stones of the vast temple
of the Reformation.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XV.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">THE PARDON OF ROME AND THE PARDON OF HEAVEN.<br />
 (<span class="smc">June and July 1532.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">OLIVÉTAN'S teaching had not been fruitless. There
occurred erelong an evangelical manifestation in Geneva,
which was an important step, and the first
public act of Reform. Calvin's cousin may have been
the instrument, though Clement VII. was the proximate
cause.</p>

<p class="side">=THE JUBILEE.=</p>

<p>The pope was preparing at that time to publish, not
a local pardon like that of St. Claire, but a universal
jubilee. It was the general topic of conversation in
many places, and some told how it had originated.
'On the eve of the new year, 1300,' said a scholar,
jeeringly, 'a report spread suddenly through Rome
(no one knew from whence it came) that a plenary
indulgence would be granted to all who should go
next morning to St. Peter's. A great crowd of Romans
and foreigners hurried there, and in the midst
of the multitude was an aged man who, stooping
and leaning on his staff, wished also to take part in
the festival. He was a hundred and seven years old,
people said. He was conducted to the pope, the
proud and daring Boniface VIII. The old man told
him how, a century before, an indulgence of a hundred
years had been granted on account of the jubilee; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">{616}</a></span>
remembered it well, he said. Boniface, taking advantage
of the declaration of this man, whose mind was
weakened by age, decreed that there should be a
plenary indulgence every hundred years.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_899" id="Ref_899" href="#Foot_899">[899]</a></span>
The great
gains which were made out of it, led to the jubilee
being appointed to be held successively every fifty
years, thirty-three years, and twenty-five years. But
the jubilee of the twenty-fifth year did not always
hinder that of the thirty-third.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_900" id="Ref_900" href="#Foot_900">[900]</a></span></p>

<p>At Geneva people were already beginning to talk
much about the coming jubilee. Olivétan and his
friends were scandalised at it. The heart of this just
and upright man was distressed at seeing the pardon
of God set aside in favour of a festival of human invention,
in which, in order to obtain remission of sins,
it was necessary to frequent the churches during
a fixed number of days, and perform certain works,
and whose surest effect was a large increase to the
revenues of the pope. The schoolmaster maintained
that if any one sought to find repose of conscience in
such inventions, he would waste his time; his heart
would be lulled to sleep in forgetfulness of God, or be
full of fear and trembling until it had found repose in
Jesus Christ. 'Christ alone is our peace,' he said,
'and alone gives our conscience the assurance that
God is appeased and reconciled with it.'</p>

<p>Men's minds were soon in a great ferment in Geneva.
People met and talked about it in the streets, and everywhere
began to murmur. 'A fine tariff is the pope's!'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">{617}</a></span>
said the more decided of the huguenots. 'Do you want
an indulgence for a false oath? Pay 29 livres 5 sols.
Do you want an indulgence for murder? A man's life
is cheaper; a murder will only cost you 15 livres 2 sols
6 deniers.' They added, 'that the pretended treasury
of indulgences, from which the pope took the wares
he sold to every comer, was an invention of the
devil.'</p>

<p class="side">=ENCROACHMENTS OF THE CLERGY.=</p>

<p>It was thus that the christians, whom preceding
ages had kept down, began to reappear in the
Church. The lay spirit was manifested in Geneva.
Baudichon de la Maison-Neuve, one of the most determined
huguenots, had frequent conversations with
other good <i>Lutherans</i>, all of whom complained of the
domineering spirit of the clergy, who had monopolised
everything. Such complaints were, however, universal
throughout christendom. In the earliest times,
said the people, the <i>priests</i> began by confiscating the
rights of the laity; and erelong these shepherds had
nothing but silly <i>sheep</i> under their crooks.... But while
the priests were engrossed in this work, another was
going on behind their backs which they did not observe.
The <i>bishops</i> did to the priests what the priests had
done to the laity; and when the inferior functionaries
of the Church had succeeded in catching the flocks in
their trap, they found in their turn that they had fallen
into the bishops' pitfall. At the Council of Cologne
(<small>A.D.</small> 346) there were ten priests, presbyters, or elders,
in addition to the fourteen bishops; but that was the
last time. At the Councils of Poitiers, Vaison, Paris,
and Valence (all held in the latter half of the fourth
century), none but bishops were present. Subsequently,
indeed, a <i>delegated</i> priest was found in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">{618}</a></span>
three councils; but at last this single priest was
politely dismissed. While the bishops were busied
with this conquest, another was going on; and they
had no sooner confiscated the rights of the priests (as
the priests had confiscated those of the laity), than
they found their own confiscated by the <i>pope</i>. All
rights had come to an end. Flocks, priests, bishops—all
had lost their liberty. The pope was the Church.
One monster had swallowed the other, to be swallowed
in its turn. Nothing is more sad, nothing more disastrous,
than this tragic history. <i>Quod des devorat.</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_901" id="Ref_901" href="#Foot_901">[901]</a></span>
The Romish hierarchy devours everything that is
given to it. The Reformation was to restore that
christian society which the clerical society had put
out of sight.</p>

<p class="side">=GOD'S PARDON.=</p>

<p>And so it happened at Geneva. Their rights as
christians were among the first claimed by these
Genevans, who were so enamoured of their rights as
citizens. 'If the pope <i>sells</i> indulgences,' said they,
'the Gospel <i>gives</i> a free pardon. Since Rome advertises
her pardon, let us advertise that of the Lord.'
These reformers, who were probably among the
number of Olivétan's hearers, drew up, conjointly,
a 'heavenly proclamation,' in simple and evangelical
terms: it is possible that Olivétan himself was the
author. Baudichon de la Maison-Neuve took the draft,
hurried off with it to a printer, and ordered him to
print it in bold characters. After that, certain huguenots,
the most zealous of whom were Maison-Neuve
and Goulaz, arranged their plans; and early in the
morning of the 9th of June they posted on the walls,
in different parts of the city, the <i>great general pardon</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">{619}</a></span>
<i>of Jesus Christ</i>,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_902" id="Ref_902" href="#Foot_902">[902]</a></span>
at such a height that every one could
read it. At that time there was in front of St. Pierre's
a pillar on which the clerical notices were displayed;
Goulaz went to it, and over one of the announcements
of the Roman jubilee he fastened the proclamation of
Gospel pardon.</p>

<p>The sun had risen above the Alps: it was already
broad daylight; the city woke from its slumbers;
windows and doors were opened, and the people began
to pass through the streets. They stared and stood
still in surprise before these proclamations.... Men
and women, priests and friars, crowded in front of the
placards, and read with amazement the following words,
which sounded strange to them:—</p>

 <p class="gap-above2
 center"><span class="small">GOD, OUR HEAVENLY FATHER</span><br />
         <span class="x-small">PROMISES</span><br />
         <span class="spaced">A GENERAL PARDON OF ALL HIS SINS</span><br />
         <span class="small">TO EVERY ONE WHO FEELS SINCERE REPENTANCE,</span><br />
         <span class="x-small">AND POSSESSES</span><br />
         <span class="small">A LIVELY FAITH IN THE DEATH AND PROMISES</span><br />
         <span class="x-small">OF</span><br />
         <span class="small">JESUS CHRIST.</span></p>

<p>'This cannot surely be a papal indulgence,' said
certain huguenots, 'for money is not mentioned in it.
Salvation given gratuitously must certainly come from
heaven.' But the priests thought differently; they
looked upon the placard as a defiance of the pope's
pardon, and their wrath grew fiercer than ever. They
insulted those whom they believed to be the authors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">{620}</a></span>
of the proclamation, overwhelmed them with abuse,
and attacked them not only with their fists, but with
the weapons which they had provided.<span

made a great uproar,' says the pseudo-Bonivard;
'and when the priests tried to tear down the said
placards, the believers, whom they called <i>Lutherans</i>,
showed themselves and prevented them, which caused
a great commotion among the people.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_904" id="Ref_904" href="#Foot_904">[904]</a></span>
In a short time the parties were organised: the burghers
gathered together in groups. On one side were the
citizens, who defended the placards; on the other, the
priests and their followers, who wanted to pull them
down.</p>

<p>A canon, named Wernly, a native of Friburg, had
remained in Geneva; he was a stout active man, of
hasty temper, a fanatical papist, who could handle the
sword as skilfully as the censer, and give a blow as
readily as he gave holy water. Having heard the
tumult, he ran out of his house, went towards the
cathedral, and just as he was about to enter he caught
sight of the placard which Goulaz had fastened to the
pillar. He flew into a rage, rushed up to the paper,
and tore it down with a coarse oath. Goulaz, one of
those bold spirits who brave those whom they despise,
was standing close by, watching all that took place.
Seeing what the canon had done, he went up to the
pillar, and calmly put another paper in the place of
that which Wernly had pulled down. Immediately
the Friburger lost all self-control: the heretic and not
the paper was the object of his rage. He rushed at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">{621}</a></span>
Goulaz, dealt him a violent blow; and then, not content
with this chastisement, drew his sword (for the
canons wore swords at that time), and would have
struck him. Goulaz was by no means a man of
patient temper, and, seeing the canon's sword, immediately
drew his own, put himself on the defensive, and
in the struggle wounded Wernly in the arm. There
was a great uproar immediately; the partisans of the
priests fell upon the audacious man who had dared
defend himself against that holy personage; the huguenots,
on their part, rallied round Goulaz, and defended
him.</p>

<p class="side">=STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE TWO POWERS.=</p>

<p>A battle between the priest and the layman, a
struggle between clerical and secular society, then
occurred in Geneva. The priests had determined
that the placards should be torn down everywhere;
and, accordingly, there was a loud noise of discord and
battle, not only in front of the porch of St. Pierre's,
but through great part of the city. 'Nothing could be
seen,' says a writer, 'but strife, conflicts, and drawn
swords.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_905" id="Ref_905" href="#Foot_905">[905]</a></span>
Two men of the priests' party were wounded
in the Bourg de Four. The magistrates, being informed
of what was going on, hurried to the spot, and
separated the combatants.</p>

<p>Goulaz certainly did not represent the Reform; he
was merely a Genevese patriot, and somewhat hasty;
but the Romish Church could not disown a canon;
he was truly its representative, and men asked whether
the Church intended to combat the Gospel with sword
and fist. During this sharp skirmish between the
ultramontanes and the huguenots, one party held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">{622}</a></span>
aloof and rejoiced in secret: they were the partisans
of Savoy. They imagined that since the two great
Genevan parties were quarrelling, they would be found
erelong, wearied with civil discord, bending the knee
to the absolute government of his most serene highness.
Division would be their strength.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_906" id="Ref_906" href="#Foot_906">[906]</a></span></p>

<p>The news of this battle soon reached Friburg.
People there had already begun to talk of a certain
schoolmaster who was preaching the Gospel at Geneva,
and the placard which had set all the city in commotion
was (they thought) the result of his sermons.
Friburg was excited, for in this matter there was
something far more alarming than a blow dealt at a
Friburger—it was a blow aimed against the papacy.</p>

<p class="side">=THE INTERDICT OF THE COUNCIL.=</p>

<p>On the 24th of June, Councillor Laurent Brandebourg
arrived at Geneva, and having been introduced
to the council, he complained, in the name of the
catholic canton, of what had taken place, and particularly
of the books and placards which led men to 'the
new law,' and threw contempt on the authority of the
bishop and the pope. 'Everybody assures us,' he
said, 'that you belong to the Lutheran party. If it
be so, gentlemen, we shall tear up the act of alliance
and throw the pieces at your feet.' These words,
accompanied by a corresponding gesture, alarmed the
council. 'The Friburg alliance has never been more
necessary than now,' they whispered to one another.
There were still among the Genevans many zealous
Roman-catholics; the evangelicals were the rare exceptions;
a great number, as we have said, held
to a certain negative middle way. The threats of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">{623}</a></span>
Friburg disturbed the magistrates. 'We are not
Lutherans,' answered the premier syndic. 'Well,
then,' resumed the catholic Brandebourg, 'summon
Goulaz before the ecclesiastical court.' The council
replied that the <i>general pardons</i> had been stuck up
without their knowledge, that they disapproved of
such excesses, that Goulaz had only struck the canon
in self-defence, after having received a blow and seen
him draw his sword, and that, nevertheless, he had
been fined. The council added that they would go
further to satisfy Friburg. Immediately they forbade,
by sound of trumpet, any papers to be posted up
without their permission; and then, as the priests
cried out louder against Olivétan than against Goulaz,
the syndics ordered that, 'for the present, <i>the schoolmaster</i>
should discontinue preaching the Gospel.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_907" id="Ref_907" href="#Foot_907">[907]</a></span>
They fancied they had thus completely rooted out the
evil. The ultramontane party, delighted at this
triumph, thought the moment had arrived for effecting
a thorough reaction. The priests began to search
after the Holy Scriptures, visiting every family, and
demanding the surrender of their New Testaments.</p>

<p>The people began to murmur. 'The priests want
to rob us of the Gospel of Jesus Christ,' said the huguenots,
'and in its place they will give us ... what?...
Romish fables.... We must begin again to read
the stories in the Golden Legend. Really it is quite
enough to hear them at church.' Baudichon de la
Maison-Neuve and his friends urged the council to
show themselves christians. They represented that it
was shameful to see priests and monks set so little store
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">{624}</a></span>
by the gospels and epistles, and fill the ears of their
congregations with human inventions. Olivétan had
often told them that there was no intention of introducing
a new religion, but of reestablishing an old
one—that of the apostles. This idea, so simple and
so true, was easily understood. The triumph of which
the priests had dreamt was changed into a triumph for
the Gospel. 'The party of the <i>Lutherans</i>,' says an
ancient manuscript, 'or, as they called themselves, of
the <i>evangelicals</i>, became more numerous and stronger
every day among the magistrates and people.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_908" id="Ref_908" href="#Foot_908">[908]</a></span>
The friends of the Reformation who were on the council
began to speak out boldly of the rights of the Word of
God. Others who were not Lutherans were generally
honest men, and they thought it very christian-like,
and even quite catholic, to preach the Gospel, and
not mere fables. They were unwilling that it should
be said of the Church to which they belonged, that it
was supported by visions and sham miracles. The
council therefore ordered (unanimously, as it would
appear) the grand vicar, De Gingins of Bonmont, 'to
take measures that in every parish and convent
the Gospel should be preached <i>according to the truth,
without any mixture of fables</i> or other human inventions.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_909" id="Ref_909" href="#Foot_909">[909]</a></span>
The evangelicals, in their turn, were delighted
at this order. They knew that the magistrates
did not intend abolishing the Roman worship; yet it
was the first official act in Geneva in a direction
favourable to the Reformation. They accordingly
showed great respect for the syndics under whom this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">{625}</a></span>
decree was passed: they were Guillaume Hugues,
Besançon's brother; Claude Savoie, a man of great
energy; Claude du Molard, and Ami Porral, a clever,
intelligent man, already gained to the Gospel.</p>

<p class="side">=NUNCIO AND ARCHBISHOP AT CHAMBÉRY.=</p>

<p>Without the city, men's opinions were very different.
The preachings 'in the houses of Geneva, the <i>abominable
Lutheran heresy</i> that was taught even in the
schools,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_910" id="Ref_910" href="#Foot_910">[910]</a></span>
had caused a lively emotion in the catholic
provinces adjoining the city, which was increased by
the <i>general pardon of Jesus Christ</i>. At Chambéry
people's minds were greatly agitated. Some, losing
all self-control, would have liked to see the thunderbolts
of heaven hurled against Geneva; others, more
merciful and perhaps more prudent, would have entreated
the Genevese, even with tears, to remain faithful
to the papacy. There happened at this time to be
a great crowd of priests at the palace of the Bishop of
Chambéry; a papal nuncio was passing through that
city, and the archbishop, the nuncio, and his attendants
had some conversation about Geneva, loudly deploring
its apostasy. The nuncio, a violent Romanist,
would immediately have brought the facts to the knowledge
of the pope, in order that the court of Rome
should take proceedings in conformity with the severity
of the ecclesiastical laws. The archbishop checked him;
he preferred making a prior application to the council.
Accordingly he wrote a letter to the syndics, in which,
after mentioning the various charges against the Genevese,
he added: 'Can it be true that such things
are taking place in a city so long renowned for its
faith?... This would be so serious a matter that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">{626}</a></span>
should be compelled to report it immediately to Rome....
Put it in our power to tell the holy father that you
will preserve a perpetual confidence in the holy apostolic
see.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_911" id="Ref_911" href="#Foot_911">[911]</a></span></p>

<p>The syndics, who had no desire to declare either in
favour of Rome or of Wittemberg, were greatly embarrassed.
One of them, however, found a way of
getting out of the difficulty. 'Let us make no reply,'
he said. When the archbishop's messenger came for
their answer, the syndics called him before them, and
gave him this verbal message: 'Tell Monseigneur
that we desire to live in a christian manner, and in
accordance with the law of Christ.' The archbishop,
the nuncio, and the pope might understand that as
they pleased. It was soon seen that Rome and Savoy
had no intention of permitting Geneva to live according
to that <i>law of Christ</i> which the city had invoked.</p>

<p>But if the papacy was uneasy, evangelical christians
rejoiced. They believed that an important position
had been gained by the Reformation, and, supposing
the Genevese to be more advanced in the faith than
they really were, rejoiced in anticipation over the
victories which these new members of the evangelical
body would win for their common standard. 'The
Genevans,' said one of them, 'are true <i>christian knights</i>,
who, having no respect for men who will soon pass
away, do not fear to offend their superiors, the enemies
of truth.'—'The Genevans,' said another, 'are energetic
men: if they embrace the Gospel, they will know
how to propagate it elsewhere.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_912" id="Ref_912" href="#Foot_912">[912]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">{627}</a></div>

<p>The old evangelicals went further than this: they
felt full of love for the new brethren. They desired
to give them a welcome, to stretch out the hand of
brotherhood to them, to receive them, with the charity
of Christ, into that small and humble Church which
was to increase from year to year and from age to age.
They were not too sanguine, however: they knew the
moral state of the Genevans; they knew that the
little flock was still weak, and but just beginning to
pronounce the name of Christ and to walk in his way.
These old christians desired, therefore, to approach it
as a father approaches his child, to take it by the hand,
to point out the dangers by which it was surrounded,
and to conjure it to remain firm, and to increase in
that faith which it was beginning to confess boldly.</p>

<p class="side">=LETTER FROM THE BRETHREN AT PAYERNE.=</p>

<p>Between the Alps and the Jura, on the road leading
from Lausanne to Berne, is situated a small town, clustered
ages ago round an abbey which the famous Queen
Bertha had declared exempt from all suzerainty, even
from that of the pope, and which, in 1208, had resisted
the Emperor Rodolph of Hapsburg. In one of the
houses of this town of Payerne, some pious christians
assembled in June 1532, under their pastor Anthony
Saunier of Moirans, in Dauphiny, a friend of Farel.
They conversed about <i>the destruction of the papistical
realm</i>, and the news they had received from Geneva, and
were full of hope that that city would contribute erelong
towards the so much desired destruction. One
of them proposed to send a letter to the Genevese.
They began to write it immediately, and here are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">{628}</a></span>
words which these simple-minded christians addressed
to the episcopal city:—</p>

<p>'We have heard that the glory of God has visited
you, of his grace, as his elect children, and that he is
now calling you with his everlastingly saving voice.
Beloved in Jesus Christ, receive the word of the
Great Shepherd, who gave himself once and was
offered up a living host (sacrifice) for the salvation
of all believers. God is manifesting to you the great
riches of his glory; he invites us to forsake the doctrine
of men, and to follow that of our only Saviour Jesus
Christ, which makes us new creatures and heirs of the
kingdom of God. Believe in this doctrine with all
your heart, without shame or fear of men; having the
assurance that it is good, holy, and alone able to save,
and that all others which are opposed to it are wicked
and damnable. Fear not the great number and
power of your enemies; but, for the love of Jesus
Christ, who has perfected your redemption, and who
has granted us remission of all our sins, be ready not
only to abandon your honour, your goods, and your
families, but even to renounce yourselves, declaring
with St. Paul, that neither glory, nor tribulation, nor
death, nor life, shall separate you from the Gospel of
salvation....</p>

<p>'Now we, your brethren in the second and spiritual
birth, pray the Father of lights to complete what he has
begun in you, and to illumine the eyes of your heart
by the true Gospel light, to the end that you may
know the great and inexpressible riches prepared for
those who are sanctified by the blood of Christ.
Renounce, therefore, the king of this world, and all
his followers, under whose banner you and we once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">{629}</a></span>
walked, and acknowledge our Lord as your only
master, your only God and Saviour, who gives us the
kingdom of heaven without money and without price.
Follow not what appears good and pleasant to you,
but the commandment of God our Father, adding
nothing, and taking nothing away. May his grace be
written in your hearts, and may you impart it to those
who are still ignorant and weak, by means of a meek
and tender teaching, so that the flock of Jesus Christ
may be increased by you daily. Our Lord God is
for you, and the whole world cannot prevail against
him. Be the standard-bearers upon earth of the
colours of our Saviour, so that by your means the
Holy Gospel may be borne into many countries.'</p>

<p>The council deposited the letter among the city
archives, where it may still be seen.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_913" id="Ref_913" href="#Foot_913">[913]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=STANDARD RAISED AT GENEVA.=</p>

<p>Geneva was still far from the pure and living
Christianity which breathes in this letter. The fight
between Goulaz and Wernly, the tumult occasioned
in the city by the placards of Baudichon de la Maison-Neuve
and his friends, had little resemblance (impartiality
compels us to acknowledge) to that picture,
so full of gentleness, which Jesus Christ himself drew
for us, when he described the servant of God: '<i>He
shall not strive nor cry, neither shall any man hear his
voice in the streets.</i>'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_914" id="Ref_914" href="#Foot_914">[914]</a></span>
But it is only by degrees that
the old man disappears and the new man takes his
place. It would have been too much, perhaps, to
expect that these energetic huguenots, who defended
their liberty with the courage of lions, should suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">{630}</a></span>
become meek as lambs. But already there were to
be found in that city souls who prized above everything
the <i>great pardon of Jesus Christ</i>. The proclamation
of salvation by grace, which we have described,
marks an important epoch in the history of
the Reformation of Geneva. All human religions represent
salvation as to be gained by the works and
ceremonies of man; the only divine religion, the
Gospel, declares that God gives it, that he gives it
through Jesus Christ, and that whosoever receives
this assurance into his heart becomes a new creature.
Such was the standard raised in Geneva in 1532. The
servants of God, whether natives of that city or refugees,
were to be, according to the beautiful language
of the letter from Payerne, 'standard-bearers upon
earth;' and, grasping the banner of the Gospel with a
firm hand, they were to be called, perhaps more than
others, in the sixteenth century 'to bear it into many
countries.'</p>

<p class="gap-above2">Everything gave token that the renovation of
Geneva was advancing; but it had still numerous
obstacles to overcome, and great works to achieve.
Powerful instruments were about to appear to accomplish
them.</p>

<p>Hitherto the breath of the Reformation has blown
to Geneva from the plains of France and the mountains
of Switzerland. The men of God who were to
labour most at the transformation of this city, Farel
especially, have acted upon it from without only.
But yet two months more, and that great-hearted
evangelist will enter the city of the huguenots; others
will follow him; they will be expelled from it by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">{631}</a></span>
friends of Rome; but they will return with fresh
determination, and labour with indefatigable zeal,
until, after long darkness, we shall at last see the light
of Jesus Christ shining in it.</p>

<p class="side">=GENEVA ATTACKED BY TWO PARTIES.=</p>

<p>The ancient city had not at this time to contend
with a single party: it was attacked by two antagonistic
bands at once, by the bishop on the one hand,
and by the reformers on the other. Which of these
two armies will conquer it?—Geneva, strange to say,
rejects both. Will that city be destined to belong
neither to the Gospel nor to Rome? It could not
be so, and various symptoms appeared at this time to
indicate an approaching solution.</p>

<p>The fanaticism of the Genevese clergy, the respect
felt by the magistrates for existing institutions, the
energy with which one portion of the people rejected
the Reformation, seemed to show that the movement
by which Geneva was then agitated would end simply
in the abolition of the temporal authority of the
bishop.</p>

<p>But other signs appeared to point to another conclusion.
In proportion as the love of God's Word
increased in men's hearts, respect for the Romish
religion diminished. The evangelical christians said
that salvation was a thing for eternity, while a government,
even if ecclesiastical, was only a temporal thing;
that the rights of truth took precedence of all clerical
pretensions, and that the authority of Scripture was
superior to that of the pontiff.</p>

<p>Moreover, a new element appeared. Ecclesiastical
society had sunk into slumber and death; in the
sixteenth century the Reformation aroused it and
restored it to activity and life. Farel is one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">{632}</a></span>
most remarkable types of this christian animation; his
unbounded ardour, his indefatigable labours were,
with God's help, to secure the victory.</p>

<p>It is true that this new force soon turned against
the Reform. The Romish Church woke up also, and
put itself in motion, particularly after the foundation
of the order of the Jesuits; but its activity differed
widely from that of the reformers. The latter
descended from on high; that of the Roman clergy
came from below. At all events, popery soon became
as energetic as protestantism. There was danger in
this, but there was probably a benefit also. If its
adversaries had continued to slumber, the Reformation
might have ended by falling asleep likewise. Activity
is far better than inactivity without hope. Let us not
be afraid then. By struggles the Church is purified,
the christian grows stronger, and the cause of truth
and of humanity triumphs.</p>

<p class="side">=THE STRUGGLE IN GENEVA.=</p>

<p>Geneva was about to have greater experience of such
contests, and the agitation within her walls was to become
fiercer from day to day. Combats without and
combats within. The dawning Reformation and the
ancient (yet new) liberty will see arrayed against
them the bishop, the duke, the emperor, the gentry
and their vassals, and the Savoyard troops, besides
veteran Italian bands, commanded by some of the
ablest captains of the age.... At the same time the
battle will rage furiously within. Popery, alarmed
at seeing one of its oldest fortresses threatened, will
utter a cry of rage; all the friends of the Romish
priesthood will be aroused, will agitate, and fight; a
furious opposition will raise its angry head. There
will be not only secret councils, traitorous conspiracies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">{633}</a></span>
fanatical preachings, and fierce discussions; but
also riots in the streets, armed men endeavouring to
stop the preaching of the Word, cannons planted in
the public squares, assaults with the sword, the
arquebuse, and the dagger, imprisonment, exile, and
poisoning.... At the sight of these violent combats
and repeated calamities, the thoughts of the historian
become troubled and confused. It appears to him
that the powers of darkness are marshalling their
forces in the ancient city. He fancies he can see that
mysterious being, whom a great poet describes in his
immortal verse as plotting the ruin of the world, at
the very moment when, smiling with innocence and
glory, it left the hands of the Creator—he can see
Satan descending, as he once did into Eden, and
casting the immense shade of his 'sail-broad vans'
over the gigantic Alps, over their white tops, their
calm clear lakes and smiling hills, and swooping down
upon the towers of the old cathedral to fight against
the counsels of the King of Heaven, and, by scattering
his wiles and fury all around, oppose the new creation
of a new world.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_915" id="Ref_915" href="#Foot_915">[915]</a></span></p>

<p>But to all these efforts of the powers of darkness
the men of the Gospel will oppose the resplendent
army of light. They will proclaim the love of God,
they will announce the work of Christ, they will publish
grace. They will repeat with Jesus Christ that <i>the
flesh profiteth nothing</i>; that is to say, that the grandeur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">{634}</a></span>
of the proud hierarchy of Rome, the power of its
temporal kingdom, the multitude of its servants in
so many countries and under such various uniforms,
the pomps by which its worship strives to captivate
the senses, the oracles of its traditions, sometimes
adorned with the seductions of human philosophy—that
all is profitless; but that power belongs to
God, that salvation is in the foolishness of the cross,
and that it is <i>the Spirit that quickeneth</i>. And, thanks
to the spiritual weapons they employ, two or three
humble instruments of the Word of God will scatter
the councils of their terrible adversary, destroy his
fortresses, and humble even to the dust the barriers
he had raised against the knowledge of God. The
rough Farel, the gentle Viret, the weak Froment, will
overcome the powers of Rome in Geneva, even before
Calvin, the great captain, appears. God chooses the
weak things of the world to confound the things which
are mighty, and the things which are not to bring to
nought things that are.<span
